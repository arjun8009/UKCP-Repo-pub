"""How does Local (2.2km) improve UKCP18's tools with detailed data?""","['chunk: The new Local (2.2km) provides the most physically realistic projections of extremes in local areas for  the coming decades and gives access to sub-daily information.  But, like the Regional (12km), Local (2.2km)  projections span a narrower range of uncertainty compared to the Global (60km) projections. Therefore, we  advise using the Local (2.2km) projections in parallel with other products in the UKCP18 toolkit. 1.8 The new UKCP Local (2.2km) provides, for the first time, national climate change information on a  similar resolution to that of current operational weather forecast models.  Local (2.2km) allows us to  simulate better the type of small-scale behaviour seen in the real atmosphere, including atmospheric  convection 2 , as well as the influence of mountains, coastlines and urban areas. Locally relevant information  can help to inform decision-making on future climate change, to enhance resilience, and adds further  capability to the UKCP18 suite of climate projection tools. 1.9 The new Local (2.2km) projections provide output at hourly scales which is needed for some user  applications, better informing future risk assessments.  Local (2.2km) provides data at kilometre and  hourly scales that can be directly fed into impact models and local decision-making tools. For example,  hourly rainfall data can be used to inform future changes in surface water flood risk for urban flood  management schemes and contingency planners. Data on future extreme heat can be used for decision- making around key infrastructure including bridges, trainlines and thermal performance of buildings. 1.10 Climate science is continually advancing.  We can expect new results to emerge during the coming years  from observations, and from new generations of global, regional and local climate models.  The products  and services will therefore continue to be developed over the coming months and years, informed by  further user input as well as developments in modelling capability. 2  Motion caused by the tendency of hotter, less dense fluid (liquid or gas) to rise, and cooler, more dense fluid to sink, under the influence of gravity.

"""What are the guidelines for representing climate variables in UKCP18 scenarios?""","['chunk: Additional caveats and limitations come with:  •  Derived projections. •  Extended exploratory time-mean sea level projections.  •  Tide and surge simulations. The derived projections over UK land areas use approximate methods to produce an estimate of RCP2.6  and global warming levels of 2 and 4 ° C (compared to pre-industrial). This introduces additional  uncertainties. One of the major assumptions is that we can use the climate model time series that reach  particular warming levels through the 21 st  century (transient) to inform a future that has reached a steady  warming level (stabilized). There is some evidence that future climate outcomes at a particular global  warming level can differ depending on whether that warming level is transient or stabilized (e.g. Ceppi et al,  2018). See UKCP18 Derived Scenarios Report (Gohar et al, 2018).  The extended exploratory time-mean sea level projections have much lower confidence than the 21 st   Century Projections. Consider these projections as sensitivity studies and do not interpret them as showing  the full range of post-2100 behaviour, or the most likely behaviour. The potential for additional sea level rise  from Antarctic dynamic ice discharge is even more uncertain on these time horizons, with some studies  suggesting several additional metres of rise by 2300 under RCP8.5.  The simulations of changes in tide and surge characteristics make the simple assumption of a fixed  coastline under all levels of future sea level rise.  10.  Take care when comparing/combining variables When carrying out analyses that consider more than one variable, ensure that any outcomes are consistent  and coherent in their representation of the changes. For the probabilistic projections, there is no spatial  coherence. For the global, regional, local and derived projections ensure that you choose variables from the  same member of the set of projections. For example, summer temperature from one member is unlikely to  be consistent with precipitation from another. Choosing a model based on being amongst the largest of the probabilistic climate changes in summer  does not necessarily translate into the same model being in such an extreme position in the winter  change results.

How do UKCP18 projections compare central to tail climate outcomes?,"['chunk: We have designed the probabilistic projections to provide the primary tool for assessments of the ranges of  uncertainties in UKCP18. However, they may not capture all possible future outcomes. The set of global and UK future climates has limited sizes and whilst it does cover a range of futures (with  the Met Office set of global models providing the higher end of future global temperatures), it cannot  simulate every possible future climate. This is especially true of the regional model (and consequently the  convection-permitting model used in the local (2.2km) projections) which is not driven by any climate  model simulations that fed into IPCC AR5 (i.e. CMIP5 climate models). Neither the set based on global  models, or that based on regional and convection-permitting models have been designed to support  estimates of the relative likelihood of alternative outcomes within their ranges of response, nor have they  been constructed to replicate the probabilistic projections.  The 21 st  century surge and wave projections are based upon relatively small set of CMIP5 models. It is  unlikely that these simulations span the full range of CMIP5 model responses under climate change. In  particular, these projections should be viewed as indicative of the overall magnitude of changes we might see  over the 21 st  Century.  For both the surge and wave projections, we are unable to quantify the relative  influence of the climate change signal and natural variability on the simulated changes over the 21 st  Century. 5.  How to use the UKCP18 probabilistic projections and what   they represent The future probabilistic projections in UKCP18 are an update of those produced for UKCP09. You should  interpret the probabilities as being an indication of how much the evidence from models and observations  taken together in our methodology support a particular future climate outcome.  The relative probabilities indicate how strongly the evidence from models and observations, taken together  in our methodology, support alternative future climate outcomes. There is more evidence for outcomes  near the centre of the distribution than in the tails, so we see unimodal (single-peaked) distributions. In  these, the relative probabilities for specific outcomes are typically much higher near the 50% cumulative  probability level (median) of the distribution, than for outcomes lying either below the 10% cumulative  probability level or above the 90% cumulative probability level. As mentioned above, the probabilities are conditioned on methodological choices and expert judgement.  The results may change if a different methodology is used.

What updates will FUTURE-DRAINAGE apply to UK urban drainage from new UKCP data?,"['chunk: Once new data from all 12 ensemble members becomes available, we will be able to make  more confident statements regarding the impact of the error on precipitation extremes.  We  recommend that users carry out testing of the sensitivity of any analysis to the UKCP Local  data and note that such sensitivity testing is already considered good practice in adaptation  decision making with climate data. Once the new dataset becomes available this should  become the preferred dataset for all new applications. We are aware that many users are  awaiting results from the FUTURE-DRAINAGE project that are based on the UKCP 2.2km data.  The project will provide new projections of change to surface water flooding, with updated  guidance on precipitation uplifts that should be adopted in urban drainage design and flood  risk assessment in the UK. We will work directly with the FUTURE-DRAINAGE project to ensure  that results using the new UKCP Local simulations (with the graupel code error fixed) bec ome  available for that project as soon as possible.  ? Surface winds   For surface winds, where users are already using or planning to use the UKCP 2.2km  projections, we recommend that users can continue to use the existing data but with caution.  There is some impact of the graupel code error on present-day surface winds, where the  original data may underestimate wind speeds mainly over the ocean but also over Ireland, the  Cairngorms and some north-western coastal regions. The impact on future changes in surface  wind speeds is smaller and not significant compared to the CPM ensemble spread, except  locally over the Cairngorms. Bias correction of the present day may be appropriate.  * Lightning   Due to concerns with the lightning results from the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections, lightning  data was not released in the original launch in September 2019 (Kendon et al., 2019). The test  simulation suggests that lightning occurrence will be much improved in the new simulations  with the graupel code error fixed, allowing lightning data to be released in future. This will  represent an enhancement for users not available in the original data release.  A summary of the advice on the use of the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections by impact sector is provided  in Table 1. Any existing users of the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections using metrics identified in Column  2 should rerun their analysis using the new 2.2km data once available; those using metrics in Column  4 do not need to rerun; whilst for users of metrics in Column 3, initial conclusions based on the original  data are unlikely to be radically changed, however, where possible this should be assessed with the  new dataset when available.

How does a strong NAO impact winter storms in NW Europe?,"['chunk: The term ‘North Atlantic Oscillation’ (NAO) is used to refer to variations in the large-scale surface air pressure  gradient in the North Atlantic region, which are responsible for much of the variability in the weather  experienced in the UK and Europe. The strength of the pressure gradient between the region of low near  Iceland (the ‘Icelandic low’) and the region of high pressure near the Azores (the ‘Azores high’) influences both  the strength and position of the Atlantic storm track. When the pressure difference is large, the NAO is  described as positive and the westerly winds are strong and storms tend to be stronger, more frequent and  travel across north-western Europe. When the pressure difference is small, storms tend to travel across  southern Europe. Although the NAO occurs throughout the year, it is particularly dominant during the winter. The NAO is known to be strongly associated with some historical winter flooding and wind events. By using  its relationship to UK and European precipitation, UKCP Global could potentially be used to understand the  NAO’s influence on projected increases in winter precipitation, alongside other drivers such as increases in  atmospheric moisture content. However, please note the results presented below showing the small climate  change impact compared to the year-to-year variability.

The winter Atlantic Pressure Gradient index made available in UKCP is calculated as the seasonal mean  (December-January-February) of the difference in sea-level pressure between Iceland and Gibraltar.

How do RCMs improve UK climate forecasts from GCM data?,"['chunk: 4.  Strand 3: a new perturbed parameter ensemble of   regional climate model simulations from 1980 - 2080 4.1. Overview  Dynamical downscaling using RCMs has formed an important component of UK climate projections since  the UKCIP02 scenarios (Hulme et al., 2002). Experience from worldwide research shows that RCMs add  value to simulations from global climate models, by better resolving physiographic features such as  mountains, land-sea contrast, urban effects and inland water bodies, and also mesoscale circulations and  storms (Rummukainen, 2016). Regional models can also provide improvements at larger scales that might  be considered well resolved by the driving GCM (Sørland et al., 2018). For the UK, RCMs simulate spatial  detail in climatological distributions of surface air temperature and precipitation with considerable skill (e.g.  Jones et al., 1995). They can also improve the representation of distributions of daily surface air  temperature and precipitation (Massey et al., 2015), and provide credible simulations of extreme regional  rainfall events on 1-10 day time scales (Fowler et al., 2005) . Many regional climate model simulations  (including those described below) are driven by global climate model output using a one-way nesting  technique, with a domain small enough to ensure that the large-scale circulation remains fairly close to that  of the driving model. The RCM therefore inherits biases from the global simulation (e.g. Noguer et al., 1998),  and is subject to the same limitations in relation to the representation of large-scale driving phenomena  (section 3.4).    Strand 3 provides a new ensemble of twelve RCM simulations for the period 1980-2080. This is a PPE of  RCM variants (RCM-PPE), configured at 12km horizontal resolution and driven by twelve of the fifteen  GC3.05-PPE simulations of section 3. It addresses requirements for a flexible dataset for impacts  assessments using contemporary UK modelling capabilities (user drivers 2 and 5 of section 1.3). In  particular, Strand 3 supports applications requiring detailed impacts information at local to sub-national  scales, especially those likely to benefit from the addition of skilful downscaling information to global model  output from GC3.05-PPE. In such applications, RCM-PPE provides a new resource for augmenting and updating studies based on the  HadRM3-PPE ensemble included in the suite of UKCP09 simulations (Murphy et al., 2009). Those 25km  projections were used in many UK impacts studies, including assessments of drought (Burke et al., 2010),  river flows (Prudhomme et al., 2012), water availability (Sanderson et al., 2012), flood frequency (Kay and  Jones, 2012), and effects on the electricity and rail networks (McColl et al., 2012; Palin et al., 2013).

How might UKCP18 suggest UK summer rain could alter by '70?,"['chunk: •  Over land the projected general trends of climate changes in the 21 st  century are similar to UKCP09,  with a move towards warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers. However, natural variations  mean that some cold winters, some dry winters, some cool summers and some wet summers will still  occur and users may need to factor this into decision-making. •  In UKCP18, the probabilistic projections provide local low, central and high changes across the UK,  corresponding to 10%, 50% and 90% probability levels. These local values can be averaged over the UK  to give a range of average warming between the 10% and 90% probability levels. By 2070, in the high  emission scenario, this range amounts to 0.7°C to 4.2°C in winter, and 0.9°C to 5.4°C, in summer. For  precipitation, corresponding ranges of UK average changes are -1% to +35% for winter, and -47% to  +2% for summer, where positive values indicate more precipitation and negative values indicate reduced  precipitation. •  Hot summers are expected to become more common. In the recent past (1981-2000) the probability of  seeing a summer as hot as 2018 was low (<10%). The probability has already increased due to climate  change and is now estimated to be between 10-25%. With future warming, hot summers by mid-century  could become even more common (with probabilities of the order of 50% depending on the emissions  scenario followed). •  Additionally, UKCP18 simulates sub-seasonal and sub-monthly extremes of climate and their changes,  such as daily extreme temperature and rainfall. There is also the potential for future changes in the time  spent experiencing different types of weather regimes. These can be examined using the new global and  regional projections.  Future changes at the coast and in the sea: •  UK coastal flood risk is expected to increase over the 21 st  century and beyond under all emission  scenarios considered. This means that we can expect to see both an increase in the frequency and  magnitude of extreme water levels around the UK coastline. This increased future flood risk will be  dominated by the effects of time-mean sea level rise, rather than changes in atmospheric storminess  associated with extreme coastal sea level events. There may also be changes in tidal characteristics. •  21 st  century projections of time-mean sea level change around the UK vary substantially by emissions  change scenario and geographic location.

Results are available for five emissions scenarios (RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5, and  SRES A1B).    •  Under RCP8.5 emissions, the projections show future increases in median return levels in all seasons for  all variables. By 2070, the increase in median TXx relative to 1990 is 2.5°C in winter, and 3.7-4.3°C in  other seasons, based on UK averages of regional values. The smallest median increases occur in summer  for Rx1day and Rx5day, with larger increases (5-10mm for Rx1day and 9-13mm for Rx5day) occurring  in autumn, winter and spring.   •  The results provide broad assessments of known modelling uncertainties, based on 360 climate model  simulations combined with observational constraints in the same statistical framework used for other  UKCP Probabilistic variables.   •  These uncertainties grow during the 21 st  century.

How do UKCP18's methods enhance PPE climate projections?,"['chunk: UKCP18 provides a number of tools to investigate climate variability and change over the UK land areas.  First, it provides a new set of probabilistic projections that combine information from several collections of  computer models, including those used to inform the IPCC 5 th  assessment (IPCC, 2013), with observations  using advanced statistical methodologies. The approach involves using many different variants of a  particular computer model of the climate (HadCM3) to simulate a wide range of different climate  outcomes; this is known as a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE). A statistical emulator is then set up to  estimate climate outcomes for a much greater number of climate model variants. This distribution of  outcomes is adjusted (both in the mean and the spread) by taking account of the diversity provided by  structurally different climate models feeding into the most recent IPCC climate assessment. Finally, the  projected outcomes are weighted by comparing the model simulat ions of historical climate with  observations from the real world, so that some model variants are down-weighted and others given more  weight. This is achieved within a well-defined formal Bayesian statistical framework. These estimates of the  ranges of future climate are available for several alternative future scenarios of emissions, including RCP2.6,  RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5. Unlike UKCP09, which focused on 30-year mean probabilistic projections, the  new UKCP18 projections are available for each month and season for each future year and so take better  account of year-to-year variability in climate, which can be very important for decision-making. This  broadens the probability estimates.  The significant advances of UKCP18 over previous probabilistic projections provided in UKCP09 are: the  inclusion of simulated natural interannual variability; the inclusion of models from the most recently  completed IPCC assessment report (the so called CMIP5 models, compared to CMIP3 models used in  UKCP09); a more comprehensive sampling of Earth System modelling uncertainty; and more up-to-date  observational constraints (including new metrics that account for the ocean heat uptake and atmospheric  carbon dioxide concentrations). UKCP18 also includes improvements to the detailed methodological  approach, including the statistical aspects of the methodology. The second component of UKCP18 is a new set of global climate model projections that allows users to look  at spatially coherent changes of the future at scales down to around 60km and a greater number of climate  metrics than the probabilistic projections. There are 28 projections of future climate for the RCP8.5 emissions  scenario, comprised of a set of 15 projections from the new Met Office Hadley Centre climate model  (HadGEM3-GC3.05) plus a set of 13 projections from models that informed the IPCC 5 th  assessment  (CMIP5). Together, the two sources of model projection provide a greater span of outcomes than either set of  models could alone. The GC3.05 simulations were produced by generating a perturbed parameter ensemble  (PPE) to yield different but plausible variants of the model. This set was filtered using comparisons with  observations, the scientific literature and expert judgement to leave models that give plausible simulations of  climate from 1900 to present, whilst max imising diversity of the spread in the future projections. The CMIP5  model projections were also filtered to retain only the most plausible models. The GC3.05 set is noticeably  warmer in the future global average than the CMIP5 set. However, both sets are compatible with the  statements made by the IPCC in the 5 th  assessment report about ranges of future warming for the RCP8.5  emission scenario. The spatial scale of the underlying models varies from around 150km for the coarsest  CMIP5 model projections down to 60km for the GC3.05 model projections, but for the convenience of users  the results have all been placed on the same 60km grid. A set of global projections was not provided as part  of UKCP09 and this new product was requested by users to allow the investigation of international impacts,  including those that then affect the UK, such as through international food availability or price.

The strength of the pressure gradient between the region of low near  Iceland (the ‘Icelandic low’) and the region of high pressure near the Azores (the ‘Azores high’) influences both  the strength and position of the Atlantic storm track. When the pressure difference is large, the NAO is  described as positive and the westerly winds are strong and storms tend to be stronger, more frequent and  travel across north-western Europe. When the pressure difference is small, storms tend to travel across  southern Europe. Although the NAO occurs throughout the year, it is particularly dominant during the winter. The NAO is known to be strongly associated with some historical winter flooding and wind events. By using  its relationship to UK and European precipitation, UKCP Global could potentially be used to understand the  NAO’s influence on projected increases in winter precipitation, alongside other drivers such as increases in  atmospheric moisture content. However, please note the results presented below showing the small climate  change impact compared to the year-to-year variability.  Positive (NAO) LOW HIGH Figure 1  Schematic representation of the North Atlantic Oscillation. The fluctuations in the NAO occur on a wide range of timescales. There are day-to-day changes associated  with weather systems, and slower changes associated with seasonal and longer term variability. A NAO  description is available on the  Met Office website . What is the Atlantic Pressure Gradient index and how does it relate to  the NAO? The winter Atlantic Pressure Gradient index made available in UKCP is calculated as the seasonal mean  (December-January-February) of the difference in sea-level pressure between Iceland and Gibraltar. Higher  values indicate a strong pressure gradient and are associated with unsettled conditions over the UK, while  lower values are associated with more stable UK conditions.

"""How do UKCP models under RCP 8.5 compare regional summer soil moisture changes?""","['chunk: •  The Global PPE-15 and Regional RCM-12 projections show reduced soil moisture for the period 2061- 2080 under a high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5), compared to 1981-2000.

The spatial pattern of changes is similar  across PPE-15 and RCM-12, with the south-eastern UK showing greater summer drying than the  northwest (Figure 1). •  Soil moisture observations suitable for comparison to climate models are few, so we use proxy  observations (see ‘What do the projections show in recent climate?’ for more details). In the recent  climate (1980-2000), the Global PPE-15 and Regional RCM-12 models agree well with the proxy  observations in terms of duration and magnitude of the summer dry season, but show a delay in season  onset and cessation (Figure 2). •  Both sets of models provide useful information regarding the direction of future changes (drier soils).  However, given the differences between the models and observations in the recent climate, confidence is  lower in the magnitude (by how much soils will dry) and the timing (when drying will occur). •  When analysing soil moisture and related variables in the UKCP suite of products, we advise the use of  both sets of models in any analysis and full recognition of the caveats and limitations of the datasets  before using the data, for example for impacts modelling.

What limits consistency in surge and wave projections using CMIP5 and Euro-CORDEX?,"['chunk: •  The 21 st  century surge and wave projections are based upon relatively small CMIP5 model ensembles. It  is unlikely that these simulations span the full range of CMIP5 model responses under climate change.  These projections should be viewed as indicative of the overall magnitude of changes we might see over  the 21 st  century. For both these sets of simulations, we cannot be sure of the relative influence of the  climate change signal vs natural variability.  •  The extended time-mean sea level projections have much lower confidence than the 21 st  century  projections. These projections can be considered as sensitivity studies and should not be interpreted as  showing the full range of post-2100 behaviour, or the most likely behaviour. The potential for additional  sea level rise from Antarctic dynamic ice discharge is even more uncertain on these time horizons, with  some studies suggesting several additional metres of rise by 2300 under RCP8.5.  •  The simulations of changes in tide and surge characteristics make the simple assumption of a fixed  coastline under all levels of future sea level rise. However, several global tide model studies (e.g. Pickering  et al, 2017) find that tidal changes are very sensitive to coastal management practices. Thus, the  findings presented here need to be interpreted as illustrative of potential changes. Further work is  needed under more realistic model configurations to make progress in this research avenue.  •  One of the limitations of the storm surge and waves projections presented in this report was the  availability of high frequency CMIP5 climate model output needed to drive surge and wave model  simulations. The storm surge projections (presented in section 3.2) made use of dynamically downscaled  data provided as part of the Euro-CORDEX project. Only a handful of Euro-CORDEX simulations had the  high frequency surface wind and pressure data required to drive the storm surge model. The wave  projections (presented in section 3.4) were limited to existing global and regional wave model  simulations that had already been carried out as part the EU RISES-AM and COWCLIP projects. It was  not possible to include the GFDL-ESM2M model (which provides our largest increase in the atmospheric  drivers of surge) among our wave simulations. This limited the degree of consistency we were able to  achieve across the surge and wave modelling components and resulted in model ensembles that are  much  smaller than for the time-mean sea level projections. •  The primary effect of mean sea level increase on waves is to increase the mean height around which the  waves fluctuate, leading to increased over-topping and coastal flooding. An important secondary inshore  effect arises as follows. The maximum amplitude of waves before breaking in shallow water is limited by  the water depth. Thus, an increase in mean sea level will in general have the secondary effect of moving  the surf zone further inshore, increasing the wave energy available at the coast for over-topping and  coastal erosion, thereby exacerbating the primary effect. Users should be aware that we do not assess  this secondary inshore effect here: our assessment of changes in the wave climate focusses on offshore  wave changes.    Finally, all users need to be aware that as our understanding of the climate system and our ability to model  it improves, and as computing power increases, it is likely that future projections will be refined. A  consequence of these expected improvements is that both the climate model projections and probability  distribution for a given outcome are likely to evolve in the future.

These are referred to as RCM-12. We expect water balance data to become available from UKCP Local (Kendon et al, 2019) at a future date,  when we will update this factsheet. The probabilistic projections are not considered here because they do  not include detailed water balance variables such as soil moisture of evaporation, as discussed in the  UKCP18 Land Science Report (Murphy et al, 2018). Of the 28 Global simulations, soil moisture data is  available for few of the CMIP5-13. Therefore, this document will focus on the results from the UKCP Global  PPE-15 and UKCP Regional RCM-12, and although this means that a smaller range of uncertainty (derived  from choice of global climate model) is sampled than for variables such as rainfall or temperature, these data  represent the best available understanding of soil moisture and related variables that we currently have.

How do CPMs project UK winter temp. and summer precip. under RCP8.5?,"['chunk: •  The CPM results do not change the UKCP18 headline message of a greater chance of warmer wetter  winters and hotter drier summers across the UK in future (Lowe et al, 2018). For 2061-80, under a high  emission scenario (RCP8.5), the CPM ensemble suggests winters will be warmer by 1.8-3.3ºC 1  and  wetter by 16-42%, whilst summers will be hotter by 3.6-5.0ºC and drier by 16-46%. In general the CPM  reinforces the results from the 12km RCM, projecting similar overall changes to UK climate. However the  CPM results do provide new information in terms of winter mean precipitation changes, changes in  extremes and changes at local scales (Section 4, Table 5.1). •  Mean temperature increases everywhere and in all seasons in future, with the greatest increases  occurring in the south. The CPM ensemble shows increases in hot summer days (3.7-6.8ºC 1  increase by  the 2070s under RCP8.5) and the frequency of hot spells, reinforcing the results of the RCM. In winter,  there is a smaller increase in temperature over Scotland in the CPM compared to the RCM, with a  smaller increase in the temperature of cold winter days and a smaller decrease in the frequency of  intense cold spells. These differences are likely related to differences in lying snow, with a greater  decrease in lying snow in the future in the RCM. •  Average winter precipitation increases in future, with the possible exception of northern Scotland where  decreases are possible. We find that the CPM shows much greater increases than the RCM (27%  compared to 16% increase 2 ), due to greater increases in the number of wet days. This may be because it  rains so often in the present-day in the RCM that there is little scope for this to increase further, although  more research is needed to investigate this. Also the better representation of convective showers and  their movement inland in the CPM may be a factor. •  Average summer precipitation decreases in future in the CPM ensemble, again with the possible  exception of northern Scotland. The average changes are broadly consistent between the CPM and RCM  ensembles, but the underlying changes in rainfall on a day-to-day and hour-to-hour basis are quite  different. In particular, it rains less often in the future, but the rain is heavier when it does – and this shift  to more intense rainfall in summer is more pronounced in the CPM projections. These changes in rainfall  are primarily driven by increased moisture in the atmosphere with warming, leading to heavier rainfall,  which is captured by both the CPM and RCM. However, local processes within the storms themselves  can amplify increases, and these are only represented in the CPM projections. •  Hourly precipitation extremes increase in future. The CPM shows increases of 25% 3  in the precipitation  associated with an event that occurs typically once every 2 years. RCM projections for hourly extremes  are considered unreliable. Use of projections •  The release of the CPM projections provides further capability to the UKCP18 suite of climate projection  tools.

Information about storm surges and waves is in other UKCP Guidance (Fung et  al., 2018a).  What are storms? In this document, we focus on the two types of storm that affect the UK (Figure 1): large-scale low pressure  systems or windstorms, that bring rain and wind over hundreds of kilometres and can last for a few days;  and smaller-scale thunderstorms with hazards possibly including rain, hail, lightning and tornadoes affecting  a few kilometres for a few hours.

There is some impact of the graupel code error on present-day surface winds, where the  original data may underestimate wind speeds mainly over the ocean but also over Ireland, the  Cairngorms and some north-western coastal regions. The impact on future changes in surface  wind speeds is smaller and not significant compared to the CPM ensemble spread, except  locally over the Cairngorms. Bias correction of the present day may be appropriate.  * Lightning   Due to concerns with the lightning results from the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections, lightning  data was not released in the original launch in September 2019 (Kendon et al., 2019). The test  simulation suggests that lightning occurrence will be much improved in the new simulations  with the graupel code error fixed, allowing lightning data to be released in future. This will  represent an enhancement for users not available in the original data release.  A summary of the advice on the use of the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections by impact sector is provided  in Table 1. Any existing users of the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections using metrics identified in Column  2 should rerun their analysis using the new 2.2km data once available; those using metrics in Column  4 do not need to rerun; whilst for users of metrics in Column 3, initial conclusions based on the original  data are unlikely to be radically changed, however, where possible this should be assessed with the  new dataset when available. Further details on the impacts of the graupel code error are provided in  Part 2 and summarised in Table 2.', 'chunk: The new Local (2.2km) provides the most physically realistic projections of extremes in local areas for  the coming decades and gives access to sub-daily information.  But, like the Regional (12km), Local (2.2km)  projections span a narrower range of uncertainty compared to the Global (60km) projections. Therefore, we  advise using the Local (2.2km) projections in parallel with other products in the UKCP18 toolkit. 1.8 The new UKCP Local (2.2km) provides, for the first time, national climate change information on a  similar resolution to that of current operational weather forecast models.  Local (2.2km) allows us to  simulate better the type of small-scale behaviour seen in the real atmosphere, including atmospheric  convection 2 , as well as the influence of mountains, coastlines and urban areas. Locally relevant information  can help to inform decision-making on future climate change, to enhance resilience, and adds further  capability to the UKCP18 suite of climate projection tools. 1.9 The new Local (2.2km) projections provide output at hourly scales which is needed for some user  applications, better informing future risk assessments.  Local (2.2km) provides data at kilometre and  hourly scales that can be directly fed into impact models and local decision-making tools. For example,  hourly rainfall data can be used to inform future changes in surface water flood risk for urban flood  management schemes and contingency planners. Data on future extreme heat can be used for decision- making around key infrastructure including bridges, trainlines and thermal performance of buildings. 1.10 Climate science is continually advancing.  We can expect new results to emerge during the coming years  from observations, and from new generations of global, regional and local climate models.  The products  and services will therefore continue to be developed over the coming months and years, informed by  further user input as well as developments in modelling capability. 2  Motion caused by the tendency of hotter, less dense fluid (liquid or gas) to rise, and cooler, more dense fluid to sink, under the influence of gravity.

How does correcting the graupel code error impact UKCP 2.2km's lightning sim?,"['chunk: An error was found within the UKCP 2.2km climate model in the microphysics code that represents  graupel. Graupel is a second category of ice with higher densities and fall speeds found in convective  cloud (Forbes and Halliwell, 2003). It is included in the 2.2km convection-permitting model (CPM),  but not in the 12km regional model (where instead all ice precipitation is diagnosed uniquely as  snow, with no graupel category). The error was in the graupel auto-conversion term, which controls  the fraction of snow converted to graupel . In general, it has resulted in too much snow being  converted to graupel.  Graupel is used to calculate lightning using the McCaul et al. (2009) lightning prediction scheme, and  so this graupel error impacts the simulation of lightning. We note that lightning data was not issued  from the original UKCP Local 2.2km projections, due to concerns over its verification, likely related to  the graupel code error. Therefore, fixing the graupel code error creates the potential to now provide  lightning data as a user diagnostic.  Graupel is in the snowfall output diagnostics, but since the error was in the term that converts  between hydrometeor types rather than in the absolute amount of ice/snow, the impact on total  precipitation is smaller. Following operational practice at the time, graupel was ignored by the land  surface model JULES in the UKCP CPM, and so was not included in the snowpack (Kendon et al.,  2019). This setting was recommended due to the tendency for the convection-permitting model to  produce too much small graupel, which if included in the snowpack would lead to an overestimation  of lying snow. The consequence of this is that, since the graupel error in general meant more snow  was converted to graupel, its effect was to reduce the snowpack.  The error has been found to have been present between Unified Model (UM) versions 10.3 and 11.3  inclusive (operational between 2016 and 2020) and affects model runs where both of the following  criteria are true: (1) prognostic graupel is in use; and (2) a temporary logical switch  l_fix_mphys_diags_iter is switched on. Operational numerical weather prediction (NWP)  configurations are thus unaffected by the error since global atmosphere (GA) model configurations  do not use prognostic graupel, and regional atmosphere (RA) model configurations (including the UK  forecast model, UKV) have l_fix_mphys_diags_iter switched off. However, this temporary logical was  switched on in the UKCP 2.2km CPM to be consistent with the driving 12km regional climate model  (RCM) and 60km global climate model (GCM). This should have been a null change since the  l_fix_mphys_diags_iter temporary logical is only intended to affect models that use sub-stepping in  the microphysics scheme, which is not the  case in regional models such as the UKCP CPM.  Unfortunately, turning it on led to an erroneous section of the microphysics code being activated.   The error was detected following a detailed investigation of some simulations performed with the  same version of the model over the Colorado mountains. It was not found in the UKCP simulations  since much less precipitation falls as snow over the UK, and the impact on total precipitation is small.  In the Colorado simulations, it was found that there was nearly as much graupel as snow, which does  not agree with observations. As well as graupel amounts, the code error was found to impact  lightning flash rates, some land surface diagnostics and does change the evolution of the model,  albeit in a relatively minor way. These impacts over the Colorado mountains are expected to be  reduced over the UK, due to the comparatively lower snowfall amounts, but need to be quantified  and taken into account by users of UKCP 2.2km results.  We note that in addition to the graupel code error above, ongoing research is underway within the  Met Office on improving the representation of graupel within the operational UKV model (Field et\nheading: Part 2: Technical description of graupel code error |ukcp_graupel_technical_note.pdf\nfile_name: ukcp_graupel_technical_note.pdf\nsection_id: 616\nfile_id: 61', 'chunk: graupel code error, the simulation of lightning is considerably improved, allowing it to be potentially  provided as a user diagnostic in the new release; representing an enhancement for users.   The existing UKCP Local 2.2km data can be used for developing methods for application of the 2.2km  data and for many applications, although extra care should be taken for applications using variables  identified above as being affected by the graupel code error. This note will help users better  understand when it is appropriate to use the UKCP 2.2km data in its current form. New data from the  UKCP Local 2.2km model with the graupel code error fixed will be issued, with a planned release date  of Spring 2021, and once available this should become the preferred dataset for all applications. Whilst  many applications are unlikely to be strongly impacted by using the new data, we believe that issuing  new data will provide the widest access to all UKCP products (i.e. ensuring the same quality of data  for all locations and for all types of adaptation decision, consistent with our policy followed in earlier  generations of climate projections). The new data will also come with the benefi t of potentially  providing additional climate metrics that are not available at present. We reiterate that the UKCP  probabilistic, global and regional projections are unaffected by this issue, with no change to their use  guidance. Furthermore, we continue to recommend that UKCP products are used together, rather  than in isolation, in order to give the most complete picture of future climate.   Part 1: Advice on use of UKCP Local data  The UKCP Local 2.2km projections consist of an ensemble of 12 simulations at 2.2km resolution run  for 3 time periods (Kendon et al., 2019). The UKCP Local (2.2km) projections sit alongside a number  of other UKCP18 tools to look at climate change (Murphy et al., 2018, Lowe et al., 2018). These  include probabilistic projections, a set of 28 global 60km climate simulations and a set of twelve  regional 12km simulations. The UKCP Local (2.2km) projections are intended to be useful for impacts  assessments that require enhanced spatial detail or information on changes in extreme weather at  local and hourly timescales. However, they only downscale versions of the Hadley Centre climate  model and the RCP8.5 scenario, and so sample a narrower uncertainty range than the global or  probabilistic projections. It is important that users are aware of the other UKCP products and the  advantages of each for their application, and also that users consider the sensitivity of their  applications to  uncertainty in the UKCP outputs. Further guidance on which UKCP product to choose  is available from Fung et al. (2018a). The following advice is for those who have already used or are  planning to use UKCP Local (2.2km) data, and covers the use of precipitation, temperature, snow,  wind and lightning outputs.   The results reported in this technical note (see Part 2) show that fixing the graupel code error in the  single-member test leads to some differences that exceed the standard deviation across the 12- member UKCP 2.2km ensemble. Under the assumption that the other 11 ensemble members are  impacted similarly (although differences could be larger or smaller in other members that have the  same model physics but sample different large-scale conditions), we judge the impact of the graupel  code error to be significant compared to the ensemble spread, for some variables in some seasons,  and especially in some locations. Although the current UKCP Local (2.2km) data remains suitable for  many users dependent on application, to promote the widest access to all UKCP products in all  regions of the UK, the decision has been taken to rerun the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections with the  graupel code error fixed. These new data should be the preferred source for all new users. For  current users of t he existing UKCP 2.2km data, in many cases it is not necessary to rerun analysis  with the new data, except for specific variables and seasons (as outlined below).\nheading: graupel code error, the simulation of lightning is considerably improved, allowing it to be potentially |ukcp_graupel_technical_note.pdf\nfile_name: ukcp_graupel_technical_note.pdf\nsection_id: 594\nfile_id: 61']","Correcting the graupel code error improves the simulation of lightning, allowing it to be potentially provided as a user diagnostic in the new release.",reasoning,True,gpt-4-turbo,sections,,,,,
How does ENSO affect global climate through Walker circulation?,"['chunk: c.   Large-scale modes of variability   We evaluate El Niño-Southern Oscillation events (Figure 8), Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV,  Figure 9) and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO, Figure 10) comparing UKCP-Global with results  from 58 CMIP6 models in Figs. 8 and 9, and 64 in Fig. 10. Our assessment is limited to a simple “top- down” comparison of the intensity of variability in the relevant index values, preceded by a brief survey  of current understanding of their properties and influences.  ENSO influences climate anomalies in many world regions (Trenberth and Caron, 2000), especially  in the tropics through its effects on the Walker circulation.  Teleconnections from ENSO to seasonal  European climate are weaker, but specific influences are revealed by detailed analysis of observations.  For example, Fereday et al. (2008) found negative seasonal correlations between El Niño and a  circulation pattern resembling the positive phase of winter NAO, except for November–December which  shows the opposite relationship. In addition, Toniazzo and Scaife (2006) found that only weak or  moderate El Niños show the canonical negative NAO response in winter, while the strongest events  drive high pressure to the west of Europe that results from a tropospheric wave train originating from  the tropical Atlantic.  The NAO and AMV indices are important drivers of variability in European climate (e.g. Hurrell et  al., 2003; Sutton and Dong, 2012; O’Reilly et al., 2017; Rousi et al., 2020). The positive (negative) phases  of NAO drive higher (lower) winter precipitation and temperatures in northern Europe. For AMV,  notable influences on the UK include (in the positive phase) dry precipitation anomalies in spring and  wet anomalies in summer. AMV also exerts broader influences on decadal and longer time scales that  include rainfall in northeast Brazil and the Sahel, Atlantic hurricanes and North American (as well as  European) summer climate (Knight et al., 2006).  AMV is associated with low-frequency variability in the ocean circulation in the North Atlantic  (Delworth and Mann, 2000), but understanding the relative influences of internally-generated and  externally-forced variability remains an active topic of research. Booth et al. (2012), Bellucci et al. (2017)  and Bellomo et al. (2018) identify an external influence from anthropogenic aerosol forcing in climate  model simulations of the 20 th  century, while evidence of volcanic influence is also reported in studies of  observations and models (e.g. Swingeduow et al., 2017; Mann et al., 2021).  Internal NAO-driven variability contributes significantly to uncertainty in projected European  anomalies during the next few decades, but in historical data the dominance of internal variability  makes it difficult to identify any potential forced signal (Deser et al., 2017). Blackport and Fyfe (2022) do  find positive trends in observed NAO and North Atlantic jet stream data from 1951-2020. These lie  outside (for the jet data) and at the top end of (for NAO data) ranges found in a large ensemble of  coupled model simulations.

"""Which UKCP18 model better represents Scotland's winter snow variability?""","['chunk: •  The CPM results largely reinforce results from the RCM in terms of UK seasonal mean changes. One  possible exception is for changes in winter precipitation where the CPM suggests greater increases  compared to the RCM. Research is ongoing to understand the complex drivers behind this, but initial  analysis suggests that projections based on conventional coarser resolution climate models may  underestimate “upper-end” responses in winter mean precipitation (Section 5), although studies with  other CPMs are needed to confirm this. •  For temperature, there is no evidence to suggest that the CPM projections are more or less plausible  than those from the RCM. In some cases there are differences in the projections between the models,  notably for temperature changes over Scotland in winter. In this case, although the CPM gives better  agreement with observations, it has a less sophisticated treatment of lying snow, and so we do not have  greater confidence in its projections. Thus for temperature changes, we recommend usage of   information from Strand 1 and 2 given the more comprehensive view of uncertainties, except where fine  spatial detail is required. •  The CPM projections are expected to be the primary source of information for users interested in daily  rainfall extremes in summer or changes on hourly timescales. For these the CPM projections are  considered more plausible, due to the better representation of convection and local processes in storms  in the CPM. However, there are still deficiencies, as many convective storms occur on scales smaller than  2.2km in reality. Further research is needed to assess the importance of these deficiencies for future  projections. Projections of hourly rainfall change from conventional climate models are unreliable.  Coarser resolution models also likely underestimate increases in summer rainfall intensity, with  implications for flood risk assessment. •  The CPM is expected to better represent changes over cities, due to the higher spatial resolution and use  of a more sophisticated urban scheme, although more work is needed to confirm this. Also over  mountains and coastlines, the added spatial detail provided by the CPM may be important for some  users. •  We have confidence that the UKCP18 projections provide significant improvements on UKCP09, and  additions of new capability. Nevertheless, there are still limitations in our ability to project 21st century  weather and climate. For example, although the CPM provides a big step forward in representing small  scale behaviour in the real atmosphere, there are still deficiencies. Also all projections are conditioned on  the chosen scenario of future greenhouse gas emissions (RCP8.5) and the particular models and  methodologies we employ in UKCP18. Supporting guidance documentation is being developed with the  purpose to guide users through the new projections.  Source: Met Office © Crown Copyright 2019 www.metoffice.gov.uk Pg 6 of 153', 'chunk: •  Both models represent the spatial variability well across the UK in winter  (i.e. greater snowfall in northern and highland areas). •  The winter-to-winter temporal variability in falling snow is better represented in the RCM. •  The winter-to-winter temporal variability in lying snow is better represented in the CPM. The differences between the RCM and CPM are mainly due to the differences in the way the models simulate  snowfall and the improved representation of topography in the CPM (see Kendon et al, 2019a, Section 3.5  for further details). In the updated Local 2.2km projections (released July 2021), there is a much improved  representation of snowfall and lying snow at the surface compared to the original Local 2.2km projections  (released September 2019). In general this leads to greater consistency between the CPM and RCM. The updated Local (2.2km) model produces more snowfall over the Scottish mountains and less in the  vicinity of the northwest coastline of Scotland compared to the RCM. There is also more lying snow over high  ground in Scotland in the CPM. These differences are likely explained by the higher resolution of the CPM  leading to a better representation of mountains, and the ability of the CPM to better represent the  movement of convective showers inland. Therefore, the Local (2.2km) projections provide the best  information available on snow in the UKCP suite of products, due to the better representation of topography  and wintertime convective showers. What do you need to be aware of? This factsheet details the biases in the data, though direct comparison with observations is difficult. Users  should be aware that both the Regional (12km) and Local (2.2km) projections underestimate uncertainties,  as they only downscale versions of the Met Office Hadley Centre model. Although the local projections can provide information on small-scale weather events in the future, they  should not be confused with an operational weather forecast, which provides information on weather that is  likely to be experienced in the next few days. Instead the local projections provide a set of plausible projections  of climate change for the UK, if we follow a high emission scenario (i.e. RCP8.5). In particular, they provide  information on the local effects of changes in the types of weather that may be experienced in the future.  The local projections sample a narrower range of potential future outcomes than the full set of global  projections. In particular, the regional climate models only downscale 12 members of the PPE-15 (and are in  turn downscaled using the CPM) and none of the CMIP5-13.

What risks do extreme temps pose to transport and infrastructure?,"['chunk: Surface air temperature is a key indicator of global, regional and local climate change that has implications  for the built and natural environment, human health and critical infrastructure . Extreme heat can have a range of impacts. Brief hot spells can lead to impacts on human health, especially  in urban areas where buildings retain heat, resulting in higher night time temperatures. Impacts on transport  can include buckling of rail tracks and reductions in the safe loading of aircraft. More prolonged heat can  result in strong demands on water resource, cause pipe movement and breakages due to soil shrinkage and  create favourable conditions for wildfire. The impacts from extreme cold include a risk to health, particularly for vulnerable individuals, disruption to  utility supplies from ice build-up on electricity cables and freezing of water pipes and disruption to road, rail  and air transport. Global temperature in any given year is affected by factors such as the concentration of greenhouse gases  in the atmosphere and natural processes within the climate system. Regionally, factors including circulation  patterns and the land-sea contrast strongly affect temperature. Locally, land height and land use have an  influence on temperature, such as sea breezes and frost hollows. You may want to consider more than one variable together when analysing future climate change for risk  assessment and decision making, for example, simultaneous changes in temperature and precipitation that  may have implications for water resource management.

What's PoT's role in estimating rare climate events?,"['chunk: Extreme value theory (e.g. Coles, 2001) is used in climate research to derive probability distributions that  describe the expected occurrence of rare events (e.g. IPCC, 2012). Such events lie in the far upper or lower  tails of the full distribution of values for the relevant variable, for example daily temperature maxima that  occur less than once or twice per season. Using EV distributions compensates for sampling issues, by  supporting estimates of probability for events that may not be present in the relatively short periods of data  used to calibrate the distributions. A key assumption is that the chosen EV distribution provides an accurate  representation of the complete probability distribution of the relevant events.  Alternative approaches are available to estimate parameters of EV distributions. The block maximum  method involves using the most extreme value within each of a set of distinct blocks of data. Here, we  provide projections for the meteorological seasons (December to February, March to May, June to August  and September to November). For summer, for example, this would involve picking the highest value of TXx,  Rx1day or Rx5day from each summer over a set of consecutive years.  This method has been used in  conjunction with the generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution in several climate change papers,  including the Brown et al. (2014) study that forms the basis of our approach here. It has the advantage of  avoiding the need to select a threshold to define an extreme event, but restricts the size of the data sample  to one event per season. In the present application, therefore, we use an alternative method: peaks over threshold (PoT). This  involves using all events exceeding a specified threshold in a given season, thus considering more of the  data, and avoiding the risk of missing multiple extremes that may occur in close proximity. The PoT  approach also excludes any seasons which happen not to contain any extreme events. The results depend  on the choice of threshold, which is a subjective decision. We select thresholds designed to capture 3% of  events per season, thus seeking a balance between increasing sample size and capturing genuine extremes.  Following Brown et al. (2008), the number of events is assumed to follow a Poisson process, and the  magnitude of exceedances a generalised Pareto distribution (e.g. Katz et al., 2002). The expected number of exceedances above a level x, conditional on x exceeding the chosen threshold, is  parameterised as: (1) where  µ ,  σ  and  ξ  are the location, scale and shape parameters (e.g. Coles, 2001). With this choice of  formulation, the above EV parameters are equivalent to those used in the GEV distribution for block maxima.  We therefore use the same notation as Brown et al (2014), but using threshold exceedances rather than  block maxima to calibrate the parameters.

"How should UKCP Local 2.2km data be handled for Scotland's winter temp, considering the graupel code error?","['chunk: 9 th  September 2020  Elizabeth Kendon, Steven Chan, Hayley Fowler, Fai Fung, Jason Lowe, James Murphy, Cath Senior,  Christopher Short, Simon Tucker and Jonathan Wilkinson    Headlines  •   We have found an error within the UKCP Local 2.2km climate model in the computer code  that determines how much of the solid precipitation falls as snow and how much as small ice  pellets.   •   No other UKCP product is affected by the error, and top-level messages from UKCP in terms  of climate change in the UK are unchanged.  •   The existing 2.2km data can still be used for many applications, but extra care is needed in  the use of data for some variables and locations. The variables primarily affected are snow  and winter temperature especially over Scotland, for which the existing 2.2km data should  not be used. Also affected but to a lesser extent are winter precipitation, hourly  precipitation extremes across the UK and wind extremes over the ocean and north-west  coastal regions, and for these variables the existing 2.2km data should be used with caution.  The variables unaffected are summer temperature including extremes and summer mean  precipitation.   •   New data with the error fixed will be issued, with a planned release for Spring 2021.  •   On fixing the error, the simulation of lightning is considerably improved, allowing it to be  potentially provided as a user diagnostic in the new release in 2021.  •   This report is aimed at more technical users of the 2.2km data, providing guidance on when  applications are likely unaffected by the error or where users should wait for the new 2.2km  data.   Summary  An error has been found within the UKCP 2.2km climate model in the scheme that represents graupel,  which are soft small ice pellets with higher densities and fall speeds than snow. Graupel is typically  smaller than hail and forms when supercooled water coats a snowflake. Subsequent testing has shown  that the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections (including for temperature, precipitation and wind) can still  provide important information for many applications related to climate change but there is a need to  update the user guidance on use of the UKCP 2.2km data, with additional caveats. Over the coming  months, we will provide new additional simulations from the UKCP 2.2km climate model with the error  fixed, which should ultimately be treated as the preferred dataset.    The graupel error emerged whilst having a detailed look at simulations performed with the same  version of the model over the Colorado mountains. The error was in the code that controls the  fraction of snow converted to graupel, rather than in the total snow/ice amount, and in general  resulted in too much snow being converted to graupel. In the operational weather forecast model,  graupel is included but the section of erroneous code is turned off, and thus operational weather  forecasts are not impacted. No other UKCP product is affected by the error, and top-level messages  from UKCP in terms of climate change in the UK (Lowe et al 2018) are not impacted.  Some rapid tests have been performed for one 2.2km ensemble member to look at the consequences  of the graupel code error for the UKCP Local simulations.

What's the expected site-specific projection change post-code correction with +1.1 cm GMSL adj.?,"['chunk: The correction needed to the processing code was minimal and involved some simple refactoring of a few  lines so that baseline adjustments applied to the GMSL Monte Carlo data object were explicitly passed  through to the site-specific projections. The code fix was implemented by M.D. Palmer and then  independently checked by T. Howard. Following the refactoring of the code, the UKCP18 sea-level  projections were initially run for the four UK capital cities to check that the differences to the original  projections were consistent with the expected increase of approximately 1 cm, as discussed below. Once  this was confirmed, the code was re-run on all UKCP18 coastal grid boxes and checked against the original  projection data files. Finally, the updated projections were run on two independent software architectures  and the data files were cross-referenced and found to be a perfect match.  Since the baseline adjustment needed for GMSL was +1.1 cm it was anticipated that correction of the  processing code would lead to an approximately +1 cm (or 0.01 m) increase in site-specific projections on  all timescales. However, there is some additional subtlety due to the baseline adjustment being carried out  by individual sea-level components (see quoted text in section 2) and being convolved with the  corresponding spatial patterns of GRD (Gravity, Rotation and solid-earth Deformation, (Gregory et al.,  2019)) and local scaling between global and local expressions of sea-level change simulated by CMIP5  models (e.g., M. D. Palmer et al., 2020). These subtleties result in some small time/space dependence of the  approximate +1 cm offset. At 2100, the differences across all percentiles between the updated and original  UKCP18 projections show a range of about 0.8 cm to 1.3 cm (or 0.008 to 0.013 m, Figure 1).

How does CPM link summer rain freq. to event intensity?,"['chunk: •  The CPM results do not change the UKCP18 headline message of a greater chance of warmer wetter  winters and hotter drier summers across the UK in future (Lowe et al, 2018). For 2061-80, under a high  emission scenario (RCP8.5), the CPM ensemble suggests winters will be warmer by 1.8-3.3ºC 1  and  wetter by 16-42%, whilst summers will be hotter by 3.6-5.0ºC and drier by 16-46%. In general the CPM  reinforces the results from the 12km RCM, projecting similar overall changes to UK climate. However the  CPM results do provide new information in terms of winter mean precipitation changes, changes in  extremes and changes at local scales (Section 4, Table 5.1). •  Mean temperature increases everywhere and in all seasons in future, with the greatest increases  occurring in the south. The CPM ensemble shows increases in hot summer days (3.7-6.8ºC 1  increase by  the 2070s under RCP8.5) and the frequency of hot spells, reinforcing the results of the RCM. In winter,  there is a smaller increase in temperature over Scotland in the CPM compared to the RCM, with a  smaller increase in the temperature of cold winter days and a smaller decrease in the frequency of  intense cold spells. These differences are likely related to differences in lying snow, with a greater  decrease in lying snow in the future in the RCM. •  Average winter precipitation increases in future, with the possible exception of northern Scotland where  decreases are possible. We find that the CPM shows much greater increases than the RCM (27%  compared to 16% increase 2 ), due to greater increases in the number of wet days. This may be because it  rains so often in the present-day in the RCM that there is little scope for this to increase further, although  more research is needed to investigate this. Also the better representation of convective showers and  their movement inland in the CPM may be a factor. •  Average summer precipitation decreases in future in the CPM ensemble, again with the possible  exception of northern Scotland. The average changes are broadly consistent between the CPM and RCM  ensembles, but the underlying changes in rainfall on a day-to-day and hour-to-hour basis are quite  different. In particular, it rains less often in the future, but the rain is heavier when it does – and this shift  to more intense rainfall in summer is more pronounced in the CPM projections. These changes in rainfall  are primarily driven by increased moisture in the atmosphere with warming, leading to heavier rainfall,  which is captured by both the CPM and RCM. However, local processes within the storms themselves  can amplify increases, and these are only represented in the CPM projections. •  Hourly precipitation extremes increase in future. The CPM shows increases of 25% 3  in the precipitation  associated with an event that occurs typically once every 2 years. RCM projections for hourly extremes  are considered unreliable. Use of projections •  The release of the CPM projections provides further capability to the UKCP18 suite of climate projection  tools.

"""Which model better predicts UK highland snow, RCM or CPM?""","['chunk: •  Both models represent the spatial variability well across the UK in winter  (i.e. greater snowfall in northern and highland areas). •  The winter-to-winter temporal variability in falling snow is better represented in the RCM. •  The winter-to-winter temporal variability in lying snow is better represented in the CPM. The differences between the RCM and CPM are mainly due to the differences in the way the models simulate  snowfall and the improved representation of topography in the CPM (see Kendon et al, 2019a, Section 3.5  for further details). In the updated Local 2.2km projections (released July 2021), there is a much improved  representation of snowfall and lying snow at the surface compared to the original Local 2.2km projections  (released September 2019). In general this leads to greater consistency between the CPM and RCM. The updated Local (2.2km) model produces more snowfall over the Scottish mountains and less in the  vicinity of the northwest coastline of Scotland compared to the RCM. There is also more lying snow over high  ground in Scotland in the CPM. These differences are likely explained by the higher resolution of the CPM  leading to a better representation of mountains, and the ability of the CPM to better represent the  movement of convective showers inland. Therefore, the Local (2.2km) projections provide the best  information available on snow in the UKCP suite of products, due to the better representation of topography  and wintertime convective showers. What do you need to be aware of? This factsheet details the biases in the data, though direct comparison with observations is difficult. Users  should be aware that both the Regional (12km) and Local (2.2km) projections underestimate uncertainties,  as they only downscale versions of the Met Office Hadley Centre model. Although the local projections can provide information on small-scale weather events in the future, they  should not be confused with an operational weather forecast, which provides information on weather that is  likely to be experienced in the next few days. Instead the local projections provide a set of plausible projections  of climate change for the UK, if we follow a high emission scenario (i.e. RCP8.5). In particular, they provide  information on the local effects of changes in the types of weather that may be experienced in the future.  The local projections sample a narrower range of potential future outcomes than the full set of global  projections. In particular, the regional climate models only downscale 12 members of the PPE-15 (and are in  turn downscaled using the CPM) and none of the CMIP5-13.

How does UKCP18 Local (2.2km) boost local climate resilience through small-scale atmospheric simulations?,"['chunk: The new Local (2.2km) provides the most physically realistic projections of extremes in local areas for  the coming decades and gives access to sub-daily information.  But, like the Regional (12km), Local (2.2km)  projections span a narrower range of uncertainty compared to the Global (60km) projections. Therefore, we  advise using the Local (2.2km) projections in parallel with other products in the UKCP18 toolkit. 1.8 The new UKCP Local (2.2km) provides, for the first time, national climate change information on a  similar resolution to that of current operational weather forecast models.  Local (2.2km) allows us to  simulate better the type of small-scale behaviour seen in the real atmosphere, including atmospheric  convection 2 , as well as the influence of mountains, coastlines and urban areas. Locally relevant information  can help to inform decision-making on future climate change, to enhance resilience, and adds further  capability to the UKCP18 suite of climate projection tools. 1.9 The new Local (2.2km) projections provide output at hourly scales which is needed for some user  applications, better informing future risk assessments.  Local (2.2km) provides data at kilometre and  hourly scales that can be directly fed into impact models and local decision-making tools. For example,  hourly rainfall data can be used to inform future changes in surface water flood risk for urban flood  management schemes and contingency planners.

How does UKCP Global (60km) model NAO's effect on UK climate under RCP 8.5?,"['chunk: This is one of a series of factsheets that describe a set of indices representing large-scale drivers of UK  weather and climate in UKCP Global (60km) - a product from the latest UK Climate Projections published in  2018 consisting of 28 global climate model simulations. The factsheets and indices data are aimed at users  wishing to carry out in-depth analysis of climate model behaviour. The day-to-day or year-to-year variations in large-scale atmospheric circulation conditions over the  Atlantic and wider European region drive significant fluctuations in the rainfall, temperature or wind  strength and direction that might be experienced in a particular part of the UK. There are a number of  different ways of characterising these large-scale drivers of UK and European climate. The index covered in  this factsheet describes the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), other factsheets describe the Atlantic jet  stream (strength and latitude) and European weather patterns (sets of 8 and 30). The factsheets are  available on the  UKCP web pages  and the metrics are available through the  CEDA Archive . The European circulation indices provide users with the opportunity to explore the impact of changes in the  drivers of variability and future changes on climate variables that may have more direct impacts, such as  rainfall, windiness or local temperatures. How the large-scale drivers might respond to a warming  atmosphere as a result of increasing greenhouse gases remains uncertain, contributing significantly to  uncertainty in future changes in local weather and climate. Exploring projections in this way can improve  our understanding of the changes that we see to UK climate in the UK Climate Projections and potentially  help us to build confidence in UK climate impacts assessments. This factsheet provides an introduction to the Atlantic pressure gradient as an indicator of the North  Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). We include some key results from analysis which show how realistically the  models used in UKCP Global (60km) represent the winter NAO compared to observations, and how the  NAO changes in the projections of future climate out to 2100 under RCP 8.5. These indices are available for UKCP Global (60km) under a single high emission scenario (RCP 8.5).

"""What are the guidelines for representing climate variables in UKCP18 scenarios?""","['chunk: Additional caveats and limitations come with:  •  Derived projections. •  Extended exploratory time-mean sea level projections.  •  Tide and surge simulations. The derived projections over UK land areas use approximate methods to produce an estimate of RCP2.6  and global warming levels of 2 and 4 ° C (compared to pre-industrial). This introduces additional  uncertainties. One of the major assumptions is that we can use the climate model time series that reach  particular warming levels through the 21 st  century (transient) to inform a future that has reached a steady  warming level (stabilized). There is some evidence that future climate outcomes at a particular global  warming level can differ depending on whether that warming level is transient or stabilized (e.g. Ceppi et al,  2018). See UKCP18 Derived Scenarios Report (Gohar et al, 2018).  The extended exploratory time-mean sea level projections have much lower confidence than the 21 st   Century Projections. Consider these projections as sensitivity studies and do not interpret them as showing  the full range of post-2100 behaviour, or the most likely behaviour. The potential for additional sea level rise  from Antarctic dynamic ice discharge is even more uncertain on these time horizons, with some studies  suggesting several additional metres of rise by 2300 under RCP8.5.  The simulations of changes in tide and surge characteristics make the simple assumption of a fixed  coastline under all levels of future sea level rise.  10.  Take care when comparing/combining variables When carrying out analyses that consider more than one variable, ensure that any outcomes are consistent  and coherent in their representation of the changes. For the probabilistic projections, there is no spatial  coherence. For the global, regional, local and derived projections ensure that you choose variables from the  same member of the set of projections. For example, summer temperature from one member is unlikely to  be consistent with precipitation from another. Choosing a model based on being amongst the largest of the probabilistic climate changes in summer  does not necessarily translate into the same model being in such an extreme position in the winter  change results.

"""How do RCM and CPM precip changes vary with orography?""","['chunk: •  1) Influence of baseline.  In the present-day, winter mean precipitation is higher in the RCM than CPM  over land and the coastal sea areas (although winter mean precipitation is lower over the North Atlantic  to the northwest of the UK). This is linked to precipitation being more frequent in the parameterised  convection model, with many fewer dry days/hours (Section 3.4). Given that total precipitation is higher  in the RCM than in the CPM, processes leading to the local formation of precipitation must act more in  the RCM (since the same moisture is being advected in through the lateral boundaries), with higher  evaporation rates over sea in the RCM (Table 4.1). This is also true in the future climate, although with  smaller relative differences between the models. In future, the greater increase in winter mean  precipitation in the CPM over land is due to a greater increase in precipitation occurrence (Section 4.3),  as well as a greater increase in the contribution from intense  precipitation events (see point 2 below).  Given the large number of wet days/hours in the baseline climate in the RCM, there is less scope for this  to increase in the future (c.f. Figs 5.2 and 5.3 for relationship between present-day biases and future  changes for seasonal mean precipitation). Indeed, we find that the number of wet days/hours over land  actually decreases in the RCM in future over the eastern side of the UK (Section 4.3), in part offsetting  the increased precipitation over the western side associated with orography (see point 2). •  2) Role of orography   The largest precipitation events (in terms of hourly or daily accumulations) mostly  occur over orography in winter. It is these large events which are the main contributors to the total  precipitation (rather than the much more numerous light events) and which show the largest future  changes in actual contribution to total precipitation (Section 4.4). In the RCM it rains much more  frequently over orography, with a tendency for too much continuous generation of rain over the  mountains (Section 3.3, Fig 3.3.4). The CPM does not rain as frequently (although when it does, it does so  with greater intensity), leading to lower mean precipitation on the upslopes in the present-day (Section  3.2). Given the more frequent nature of orographic precipitation in the RCM in the present-day, there is  less scope for this to increase in future. In addition, the increases in precipitation contribution from the  highest intensities over orography in future are greater in t he CPM than RCM (Section 4.4).

What tools better assess climate risks under UKCP18?,"['chunk: The UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18) are based on the latest developments in climate science  and were subject to an independent peer review, from the commencement of the project, to assess the  science that underpins UKCP18.

The land projections include  updated Probabilistic (maximum spatial resolution of 25km) scenarios for key climate variables to support  assessments of uncertainty. The Marine projections include updated projections of time-average sea level  rise around the UK coastline, and new projections of extreme water levels, including storm surges and tides.  Together, the wider suite of UKCP products will equip government, businesses and other interested parties  to assess the challenges and opportunities we face from our changing climate. For guidance on which set of  projections to use, please consult  UKCP18 Guidance: Ho w to use the land projections? 1.2 Building on the learning from UKCP09, user groups from government and the wider society, along with  the peer review panel, have helped to shape UKCP18, co-designing tools and capabilities to better meet  user needs.  For example, (i) changing the format of the data that is provided to the widely-used Ordnance  Survey’s coordinate system, (ii) an enhanced user interface that uses the latest web design and (iii) providing  datasets that represent UK climate in scenarios of 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. 1.3 UKCP18 adds tools and capabilities, providing new insight compared to the previous projections, thus  enhancing capacity for analysing climate risks.  For example, UKCP18 includes projections for the globe,  enabling projected climate changes in the UK to be examined in a global context. 1.4 The Probabilistic projections (25km) typically provide the broadest ranges of uncertainty in future  changes for key UK climate variables and global average temperature.  These results are complemented  by the other products in the UKCP suite that provide sets of plausible projections showing how climate  might evolve within the range of uncertainty. 1.5 Global (60km) provides coverage of the entire planet, giving access to a range of plausible projections  that includes worldwide regions, as well as the UK.  Global (60km) provides information on large-scale  drivers that affect the patterns of weather in the UK. 1.6 Regional (12km) provides coverage over the UK and Europe at higher spatial detail, giving an improved  representation of daily extremes.

What's the usual P50 diff for July Tmax as % of P90-P10 spread?,"['chunk: •  Differences in the median response are typically smaller. On average, the 25km-scale differences in P50  amount to 13% of the spread in the new projections for sea-level pressure, and to 6% or less for other  variables.  •  These differences vary with season and location. For example, the differences in P50 for Tmax are largest  in July (amounting to 1.24°C on average in the 25km-scale pdfs, 18% of the average P90 – P10 spread),  because correcting the Tmax/Tmin error has its largest impact in that month.  •  For precipitation, the largest increases in spread occur in spring and autumn. In spring, the average P10  response changes from -9.4% to -20% in the new 25km projections, while the average P90 response  increases from 13.7% to 21.3%. •  In summer, the new projections reinforce existing advice (including from other components of UKCP18)  that strong drying is possible according to the P10 changes, especially over much of England and Wales.  Compared to the original results, the improved treatment of precipitation extremes generally reduces  the intensity of dry-end responses, while the downscaling correction increases the intensity. The net  effects are modest reductions in levels of P10 drying over Wales and most parts of southern England,  and modest increases in drying over most of Scotland and Northern Ireland. On average, changes in P10  amount to 4% in magnitude. •  For aggregated regions the downscaling correction has a smaller impact in general, although it does  affect the new projections in cases where the selected large-scale predictor variable (taken from global  climate model simulations) changes relative to the original calculations. On average, fractional  differences in the median response are 6% or less for all variables. Average fractional differences in  spread are largest for Tmax (12%) and Tmin (11%). Values are also close to 10% for total cloud cover  and both surface short-wave radiation variables but well below 10% for other variables. These effects  on spread are invariably smaller (on average) for aggregated-regions than for their 25km-scale  counterparts, due to the smaller impact of the downscaling correction. •  There is generally more similarity between aggregated-region pdfs and co-located 25km pdfs in the new  projections, since correcting the downscaling error removes a source of inconsistency that affected the  original results. •  Five of the aggregated regions are national definitions for England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland  and the entire UK.

For winter surface air temperature, Figure 4.8a shows the second lowest, central and second highest  responses obtained by ranking locally the changes in the 12 member ensemble, at the native 12km  resolution of the RCM. Use of the second lowest and second highest responses characterises the range of  responses within the ensemble, while reducing the influence of any outliers.

What weather event's forecast benefits from CPM_new's summer reliability and convection?,"['chunk: •  For applications focussing on extremes, particularly those requiring information on fine spatial scales, the  RCM and CPM_new products are expected to be the primary source of information.  For daily  temperature extremes, these should be used alongside the UKCP Global projections to give a more  comprehensive uncertainty range. For heavy daily precipitation events, CPM_new projections are more  reliable especially in summer, due to the better representation of convection. For hourly precipitation  including extremes, projections from convection parameterised models are unreliable and so users  should only use the CPM_new projections. However, the CPM_new projections likely underestimate the  uncertainty range. •  CPM_new (as is the case for CPM_orig) provides information on changes in hourly precipitation and for  local areas, including a better representation of changes over cities (due to the higher spatial resolution  and more sophisticated urban scheme) and over regions of complex terrain. This information can be used  in local decision making, for example in relation to urban flooding for contingency planners.  •  For surface winds, CPM_new projections differ from the RCM projections. Both projections are judged  equally plausible, but some added value is expected from the CPM in terms of representing changes over  mountains and coastal regions. •  The Local (2.2km) and Regional (12km) projections sample a narrower uncertainty range than the  Probabilistic and Global projections, as they currently lack information from other international climate  models. Where possible, we recommend that the CPM_new projections are used in combination with  other UKCP products, rather than in isolation, in order to give the most complete picture of future  climate. •  Table 1 summarises advice on use of the new 2.2km reruns compared to the original UKCP Local (2.2km)  projections and other UKCP18 products by impact sector. Present-day performance  •  The ability of the CPM to simulate several aspects of the present-day climate has been verified by  comparing the model results with observations of the real world. In general, this along with the improved  representation of convection in the CPM, gives us confidence in its ability to project future changes to  extreme weather events at local and hourly scales. •  The new 2.2km reruns (CPM_new) are considerably colder than the original UKCP Local (2.2km)  simulations (CPM_orig) in winter. This exacerbates cold biases in the north of the UK, for winter mean  temperature and cold winter days. CPM_new is also wetter in winter than CPM_orig, particularly over  high terrain, leading to slightly increased biases for mean and heavy daily precipitation. Although these  biases have increased, we have greater confidence in CPM_new compared to CPM_orig, since differences  can be traced to fixing the graupel code error. •  The representation of heavy summer precipitation and hourly precipitation extremes has considerably  improved in the new 2.2km reruns, with the tendency for the CPM to overestimate extreme hourly  precipitation reduced (by about 20%). •  CPM_new has less snowfall and more lying snow compared to the original 2.2km runs, which is a  considerable improvement and directly relates to the improved treatment of graupel and the snowpack.

How does EV theory assist in forecasting rare weather with PoT?,"['chunk: Extreme value theory (e.g. Coles, 2001) is used in climate research to derive probability distributions that  describe the expected occurrence of rare events (e.g. IPCC, 2012). Such events lie in the far upper or lower  tails of the full distribution of values for the relevant variable, for example daily temperature maxima that  occur less than once or twice per season. Using EV distributions compensates for sampling issues, by  supporting estimates of probability for events that may not be present in the relatively short periods of data  used to calibrate the distributions. A key assumption is that the chosen EV distribution provides an accurate  representation of the complete probability distribution of the relevant events.  Alternative approaches are available to estimate parameters of EV distributions. The block maximum  method involves using the most extreme value within each of a set of distinct blocks of data. Here, we  provide projections for the meteorological seasons (December to February, March to May, June to August  and September to November). For summer, for example, this would involve picking the highest value of TXx,  Rx1day or Rx5day from each summer over a set of consecutive years.  This method has been used in  conjunction with the generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution in several climate change papers,  including the Brown et al. (2014) study that forms the basis of our approach here. It has the advantage of  avoiding the need to select a threshold to define an extreme event, but restricts the size of the data sample  to one event per season. In the present application, therefore, we use an alternative method: peaks over threshold (PoT). This  involves using all events exceeding a specified threshold in a given season, thus considering more of the  data, and avoiding the risk of missing multiple extremes that may occur in close proximity. The PoT  approach also excludes any seasons which happen not to contain any extreme events. The results depend  on the choice of threshold, which is a subjective decision. We select thresholds designed to capture 3% of  events per season, thus seeking a balance between increasing sample size and capturing genuine extremes.  Following Brown et al. (2008), the number of events is assumed to follow a Poisson process, and the  magnitude of exceedances a generalised Pareto distribution (e.g. Katz et al., 2002). The expected number of exceedances above a level x, conditional on x exceeding the chosen threshold, is  parameterised as: (1) where  µ ,  σ  and  ξ  are the location, scale and shape parameters (e.g. Coles, 2001).

How do UKCP Local 2.2km Projections improve insights into local extreme weather?,"['chunk: This report accompanies the release of UKCP Local (2.2km) Projections for additional transient periods  (2001-2020 and 2041-2060), leading to 100y climate simulations for 1981-2080 that continuously span  past, present and future times, at 2.2km scale for the UK (Kendon et al., 2023). While it is common practice  in the international community to produce ensembles of continuous transient simulations using global and  regional climate models, this is (to our knowledge) the first example of such an ensemble at the kilometre  scale, with the same level of spatial detail as weather forecast models. This unique set of projections  therefore provides a key step forward in national climate capability allowing the examination of how  changes in local weather extremes may be realised over the coming years and decades. Since twelve  simulations are available, we can determine robustly their projected signals in local extremes. The transient  simulations provide a set of plausible outcomes for ea ch year through time, allowing us to put observed  events into the context of climate change.  The new 2.2km simulations augment the UKCP Local (2.2km) Projections previously updated in July 2021,  which provided data for three 20-year periods (1981-2000, 2021-40 and 2061-80). The new 2.2km  simulations provide data for the intervening periods (2001-2020 and 2041-60) and consist of twelve  ensemble members, downscaling the UKCP Regional (12km) Projections as in UKCP Local (2.2km). This  results in 100y timeseries data spanning 1981-2080 and driven by a high emissions (RCP8.5) scenario  (hereafter “UKCP Local Transient Projections”). Since each ensemble member timeseries is built by joining  five 20y simulations, there are discontinuities at the time-slice boundaries (1st of December 2000, 2020,  2040 and 2060), which means there may be an abrupt shift in the daily weather on those four dates. The  20-year simulations were preceded by a 1-year spin-up to help ensure there was only a discontinuity in the  simulated daily weather at the boundaries but not in the underlying climate  characteristics.  The set-up of  the UKCP Local projections is as described in Kendon et al., (2021a).  The km-scale (“convection-permitting”) model is able to better represent the small-scale behaviour seen in  the atmosphere, in particular atmospheric convection – a key process driving many of our extreme weather  events. Due to the high spatial resolution, compared to more traditional climate models, it also represents  better the influence of mountains, coastlines and cities. As such the UKCP Local (2.2km) data are useful for  impacts assessments that require enhanced spatial detail or information on changes in extreme weather at  local and hourly timescales (Dale et al., 2018; Slater et al., 2022; Chan et al., 2022). The UKCP Local  Transient Projections provide access to credible information on how climate change may impact extremes  of weather for your local area over the coming years out to 2080. They provide a range of plausible  outcomes for any given year, which, whilst not comprehensive, is expected to be valuable to urban planners,  local authorities and flood management pra ctitioners for adaptation planning. All projections are for the high emissions RCP8.5 scenario which, although not the most likely, remains a  plausible scenario assuming unmitigated greenhouse gas emissions. This scenario was chosen as it provides  a high signal-to-noise ratio, allowing us to robustly capture the climate change signal above natural  variability, that is also useful in inferring changes for other scenarios (for example through characterising  changes for a given degree of global warming, see section “Example applications of new UKCP Local  Transient Projections”). It provides an upper estimate that supports precautionary planning in relation to  future risks of extremes.

How do members 11 and 12 influence UKCP's climate forecasts via Atlantic circulation?,"['chunk: Background:  UKCP Global (60 km) consisted of 28 realisations of climate variables for 1900-2100 as  simulated by 28 coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models. The 28 realisations consisted of 15 variants of  the HadGEM3-GC3.05 global climate model (GCM) developed at the Met Office Hadley Centre (MOHC)  and 13 other climate models from around the world. The UKCP18 Land Projections Report (Murphy et al.  2018) flagged that there was a potentially spurious change in global temperature in the first 40 years of the  historical simulation for member 01. This report investigates this further for all 15 MOHC model variants,  and provides some user guidance on the issue of model drifts (next page) followed by some technical detail  (sections 1-4). Key points are: •  Spurious long-term changes, or “drifts”, can occur in any GCM simulation, for reasons associated with the  experimental set up. Control GCM simulations, in which anthropogenic and natural external forcings are  held fixed at pre- or early- industrial values (we use 1900), are used to expose these drifts. A drift seen in  a control simulation will also affect GCM simulations where the anthropogenic forcing is varied, such as  the UKCP Global projections. •  In the 15 MOHC simulations, the largest drift occurs in temperature for the first 30 years of the  simulations, providing a spurious increase of 0.2 °C in that period. This drift comes mainly from the  Tropics and the Arctic. Most users only use data from a more recent period onwards, usually from 1961  or 1981, and this drift does not affect projected changes calculated this way. The user guidance provides  advice if data prior to 1940 is being used. •  After 1940, 13 of the 15 control GCM simulations are essentially steady in global mean temperature  with any drift being an order of magnitude smaller than the projected changes. We advise that there is  no need to adjust UKCP projections for these small drifts. This also applies to temperature and  precipitation in the UK from UKCP Global (60 km), UKCP Regional (12 km) and UKCP Local (2.2 km)  projections, as well as most worldwide regions in UKCP Global. An exception is that a few amongst the  13 members show temperature drifts around Antarctica. •  The two exceptions are members 11 and 12 (for which there are 60 km, 12 km, and 2.2 km versions),  which show steady weakening of the overturning circulation in the Atlantic Ocean. The user guidance  states that if both members 11 and 12 stand out from the other 13 members for a climate variable of  interest, then it is very likely related to the drift in the Atlantic Ocean and the two members should be  excluded from the user’s analysis. If, however, only one of these two members stands out then the  Atlantic drift could still be playing a role, but a user would be justified in including both these members.  However, both members are examples of an early collapse of the Atlantic overturning circulation, so  could be used to develop a storyline to cover this type of event.  •  The control simulations show that internal variability in the North Atlantic Oscillation and UK  temperature and precipitation varies across the 15 MOHC variants.

How do CPMs project UK winter temp. and summer precip. under RCP8.5?,"['chunk: •  The CPM results do not change the UKCP18 headline message of a greater chance of warmer wetter  winters and hotter drier summers across the UK in future (Lowe et al, 2018). For 2061-80, under a high  emission scenario (RCP8.5), the CPM ensemble suggests winters will be warmer by 1.8-3.3ºC 1  and  wetter by 16-42%, whilst summers will be hotter by 3.6-5.0ºC and drier by 16-46%. In general the CPM  reinforces the results from the 12km RCM, projecting similar overall changes to UK climate. However the  CPM results do provide new information in terms of winter mean precipitation changes, changes in  extremes and changes at local scales (Section 4, Table 5.1). •  Mean temperature increases everywhere and in all seasons in future, with the greatest increases  occurring in the south. The CPM ensemble shows increases in hot summer days (3.7-6.8ºC 1  increase by  the 2070s under RCP8.5) and the frequency of hot spells, reinforcing the results of the RCM. In winter,  there is a smaller increase in temperature over Scotland in the CPM compared to the RCM, with a  smaller increase in the temperature of cold winter days and a smaller decrease in the frequency of  intense cold spells. These differences are likely related to differences in lying snow, with a greater  decrease in lying snow in the future in the RCM. •  Average winter precipitation increases in future, with the possible exception of northern Scotland where  decreases are possible. We find that the CPM shows much greater increases than the RCM (27%  compared to 16% increase 2 ), due to greater increases in the number of wet days. This may be because it  rains so often in the present-day in the RCM that there is little scope for this to increase further, although  more research is needed to investigate this. Also the better representation of convective showers and  their movement inland in the CPM may be a factor. •  Average summer precipitation decreases in future in the CPM ensemble, again with the possible  exception of northern Scotland. The average changes are broadly consistent between the CPM and RCM  ensembles, but the underlying changes in rainfall on a day-to-day and hour-to-hour basis are quite  different. In particular, it rains less often in the future, but the rain is heavier when it does – and this shift  to more intense rainfall in summer is more pronounced in the CPM projections. These changes in rainfall  are primarily driven by increased moisture in the atmosphere with warming, leading to heavier rainfall,  which is captured by both the CPM and RCM. However, local processes within the storms themselves  can amplify increases, and these are only represented in the CPM projections. •  Hourly precipitation extremes increase in future. The CPM shows increases of 25% 3  in the precipitation  associated with an event that occurs typically once every 2 years. RCM projections for hourly extremes  are considered unreliable. Use of projections •  The release of the CPM projections provides further capability to the UKCP18 suite of climate projection  tools.

How do UKCP18 projections compare central to extreme climate futures?,"['chunk: We have designed the probabilistic projections to provide the primary tool for assessments of the ranges of  uncertainties in UKCP18. However, they may not capture all possible future outcomes. The set of global and UK future climates has limited sizes and whilst it does cover a range of futures (with  the Met Office set of global models providing the higher end of future global temperatures), it cannot  simulate every possible future climate. This is especially true of the regional model (and consequently the  convection-permitting model used in the local (2.2km) projections) which is not driven by any climate  model simulations that fed into IPCC AR5 (i.e. CMIP5 climate models). Neither the set based on global  models, or that based on regional and convection-permitting models have been designed to support  estimates of the relative likelihood of alternative outcomes within their ranges of response, nor have they  been constructed to replicate the probabilistic projections.  The 21 st  century surge and wave projections are based upon relatively small set of CMIP5 models. It is  unlikely that these simulations span the full range of CMIP5 model responses under climate change. In  particular, these projections should be viewed as indicative of the overall magnitude of changes we might see  over the 21 st  Century.  For both the surge and wave projections, we are unable to quantify the relative  influence of the climate change signal and natural variability on the simulated changes over the 21 st  Century. 5.  How to use the UKCP18 probabilistic projections and what   they represent The future probabilistic projections in UKCP18 are an update of those produced for UKCP09. You should  interpret the probabilities as being an indication of how much the evidence from models and observations  taken together in our methodology support a particular future climate outcome.  The relative probabilities indicate how strongly the evidence from models and observations, taken together  in our methodology, support alternative future climate outcomes. There is more evidence for outcomes  near the centre of the distribution than in the tails, so we see unimodal (single-peaked) distributions. In  these, the relative probabilities for specific outcomes are typically much higher near the 50% cumulative  probability level (median) of the distribution, than for outcomes lying either below the 10% cumulative  probability level or above the 90% cumulative probability level. As mentioned above, the probabilities are conditioned on methodological choices and expert judgement.  The results may change if a different methodology is used.

How do UKCP09 projections handle uncertainties with PPEs and CMIP3?,"['chunk: The UKCP18 land projections have been designed to replace the previous UKCP09 scenarios (Jenkins et al.,  2009), taking into account subsequent feedback from users and developments in modelling capability. The  new projections consist of three Strands, described in detail in sections 2-4. The Strands are built to serve  types of user requirement that are related, but also somewhat distinct, and each Strand uses different  climate modelling inputs. For some applications it may be appropriate to consider combining information  from two or more Strands to obtain the most comprehensive advice (section 5.2). The Strands include some  inter-dependencies in their designs, to help with this. Below, we discuss how developments since UKCP09  have informed the content of UKCP18, and introduce the three Strands. We describe and evaluate their  underpinning projection systems in more detail in sections 2-4, and compare their future projections in  section 5. This includes discussion of how the resu lts should be interpreted and used, taking into  consideration the nature of the products and the degree of consistency between their results. A summary is  provided in section 6.   1.1. Recap of UKCP09 The centrepiece of the UKCP09 land component was a set of probabilistic projections (Murphy et al., 2009).  These expressed a broad range of plausible outcomes for UK climate during the 21 st  century, for a set of key  climate variables. They were provided for three future emissions pathways (the B1, A1B and A1FI scenarios  of Nakicenovic and Swart (2000), labelled “low”, “medium” and “high”), for a national 25km grid and two  sets of aggregated regions. The probabilistic projections were presented as 30-year monthly, seasonal and  annual average changes, expressed relative to a 1961-1990 baseline. They represented known  uncertainties (due to internal climate variability and the modelling of key Earth system processes),  consistent with available climate model simulations and the knowledge contained within them. The  projections were constructed from several ensembles of variants of a single climate model (HadCM3),  representing modelling uncertainties by perturbing model parameters  within expert-specified ranges. These  perturbed parameter ensembles (PPEs) were combined with results from the Coupled Model  Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) ensemble of international global climate models (GCMs), and a  set of observational metrics of historical model performance (Sexton et al., 2012; Harris et al., 2013). A  weather generator (Jones et al., 2010) was also provided. This was driven by change factors sampled from  the projections in order to assess localised impacts and risks in many applications. The UKCP09 projections  were the first UK scenarios to include intrinsic, quantitative estimates of uncertainty. They formed a major  component of the evidence bases for the first and second national climate change risk assessments  (CCRA), published in 2012 ( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-climate-change-risk- assessment-government-report ) and 2017 (CCRA2, see  https://www.theccc.org.uk/tackling-climate- change/preparing-for-climate-change/uk-climate-change-risk-assessment-2017/ ).

"""What weather risk in Yorkshire did UKCP18 stakeholders aim to assess?""","['chunk: This UKCP18 demonstration project involved a group of six  stakeholders from the Yorkshire Integrated Catchment Solutions  Programme (iCASP) who represented local government, major  infrastructure owners and technical specialists. They developed two  case studies, one on surface water flooding and the other on drought,   to consider how they might use UKCP18.  Surface water flooding from heavy downpours is a significant risk in  Yorkshire. UKCP09 had been used to assess future changes in flood risk  by two of the partners in this case study – JBA Consulting and Leeds  City Council.

What are UKCP18's limitations given its GHG scenarios and methods?,"['chunk: The approaches used in UKCP18 have been subject to a rigorous evaluation. The models used for the future  also simulate the present-day and the model results have been compared with observations. The physically  based models of the climate used in UKCP18 are based on the well-established laws of physics and the  latest understanding of how the climate system operates has been included in the projections. Further, an  independent peer review panel of scientific experts has provided guidance on the approaches and  influenced how the projections are made and presented. The panel contains many internationally renowned  experts chosen to cover the breadth of UKCP18 products. This panel, which has been in place throughout  most of the period of the UKCP18 production process, has been expanded for the final review of reports to  include additional experts. Their views on UKCP18 are summarised on the user website.  It is important for users to be aware that, although we have confidence that the projections represent a  significant improvement on UKCP09, there are still limitations in our ability to project 21 st  century weather  and climate. Furthermore, all simulations of the future are conditioned on both a limited number of  scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions and the particular methodologies we employ in UKCP18.  However, the limited number of greenhouse gas scenarios is less of an issue for the next two or three  decades than for later in the century. While the global and regional projections of future climate use the  latest climate models and are diverse they can not cover all potential future climate outcomes out to 2100  (or beyond in the case of sea level). Users making decisions based on any future climate information need to  take this into account in their decision-making frameworks. The 21 st  century projections presented in this report are produced for the RCP climate change scenarios.  The results are therefore subject to any inherent limitations of the assumed emissions scenarios.  For the climate simulations over land users need to note: •  The probabilistic projections make use of global climate simulations using climate models of many  different spatial resolutions and vintages. Like all climate models these replicate many aspects of the  observed climate but also show biases compared to observations. Furthermore, they do not explicitly  represent smaller-scale processes such as atmospheric convection. •  The probabilistic projections also adopt a particular set of methods including an approach to emulating  climate models, treatment of structural uncertainty and use of a particular simple energy balance  climate model. The approach also downscales results to the 25km scale using a statistical approach  based on a global model-regional model pairing from a single model structure. Each stage of the method  has many assumptions and relies on expert judgement. •  The probabilities represent the relative strength of evidence supporting different plausible outcomes for  UK climate, based on the climate models, physical insight, observational evidence and statistical  methodology used to produce them. However, they may not capture all possible future outcomes,  because, for example, some potential influences on future climate are not yet understood well enough to  be included in climate models.

What biases do CMIP6 and UKCP-Global share in marine stratocumulus?,"['chunk: b.   Climatology in CMIP6 and UKCP-Global simulations   For surface air temperature, Figure 3 compares ensemble median biases in the GC3.05-PPE and  CMIP5-13 components of UKCP-Global against the median bias across 47 CMIP6 coupled models.  Results are presented for the 20-year average of 1981-2000, for December to February (DJF) and June to  August (JJA). The patterns of bias for CMIP6 and CMIP5-13 are broadly similar, indicating that in most  regions the systematic components of model error have the same sign. For example, both ensembles  show positive median biases in the marine stratocumulus regions off the western coasts of North and  South America and southern Africa. Bock et al. (2020) conclude that biases in the stratocumulus regions  arise partly from limited horizontal resolution, since these biases are smaller in higher resolution models  (e.g. Roberts et al., 2019). Both CMIP5-13 and CMIP6 also show a median warm bias over the Southern  Ocean and Kazakhstan (Fig. 3), while in DJF many parts of the northern hemisphere continental  landmasses show a cool bias.  In GC3.05-PPE the median cool bias in northern hemisphere winter is more pronounced and more  widespread than in the multi-model ensembles. The Southern Ocean warm bias is also larger, despite  the use of flux adjustments (absent from the multi-model ensembles). However, in many low-latitude  marine regions the median bias is smaller in GC3.05-PPE.

The UKCP18 shelf seas model is used  to provide a spatially continuous estimate of coastal sea level variability around the UK and aid the  interpretation of the available tide gauge records. Further details on the model configuration and  experimental design are available in section A1.7.  An indicative set of UK tide gauge records and corresponding shelf seas model simulated time series is  presented in Figure A2.5.1. Tide gauges are selected on the basis of geographical coverage and the series  length. All time series are linearly detrended in order to focus on sea level variability, rather than secular  change signals. The shelf seas model simulation generally does a good job of reproducing the magnitude  and temporal characteristics (see Tinker et al, in prep) of the UK tide gauges, and accounts for between  about 60% and 100% of the observed variability (Figure A2.5.1).  Across the larger European domain, the shelf seas model does a good job of capturing the spatial variations  in the magnitude of observed sea level variability, with a spatial correlation of 0.7 based on the selected tide  gauge records (Figure A2.5.2). The model generally underestimates the observed variability, by an average  of about 1 cm.

"""Which model better forecasts UK's warmer future, UKCP18's GC3.05 or CMIP5?""","['chunk: The probabilistic projections discussed in the previous section provide context for how the projected future  climate might change, including providing information on the range of changes for different future  greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Many users have expressed a desire for also having a set of global and  regional climate model projections that represent how variability and long-term changes in climate might  evolve over the UK (and beyond) over the 21 st  century. Our design philosophy in UKCP18 has been to use  the most recent climate models to provide this evidence. This approach is consistent with a growing  interest by users in constructing internally consistent, physically based storylines that help us understand  the robustness of those particular futures that would be most relevant to a particular user. There is no  single climate projection that can provide this because different users have different interests and weather  vulnerabilities. Therefore, the UKCP18 set o f global model projections provides 28 plausible but diverse  projections from which to choose. The set comprises projections with the GC3.05 model and other CMIP5  models. Many of the global simulations from the GC3.05 model have been downscaled to a 12km scale and  will be further downscaled to 2.2km in future. The global and regional model projections are provided for  the RCP8.5 scenario.  The global model projections are shown as a time-series and compared to the spread from the probabilistic  projections in Figure 2.13 for global mean temperature change. It is clear that the GC3.05 models tend to  sample the warmer end of the future response range projected by the probabilistic approach and CMIP5  models sample the mid-range and colder end – with some limited overlap in the middle. This is consistent  with recent research into a HADGEM3 model version (GC3.1), to which the UKCP18 GC3.05 versions of the  model are closely related, having an equilibrium climate sensitivity above the likely end of the current IPCC  range, and higher than the CMIP5 set of models. However, potential users should note that the projected  response over the UK has a wider spread in both GC3.05 and CMIP5 projection sets and the degree of  overlap of the sets is greater.

What UKCP Local 2.2km vars should be used cautiously due to graupel error?,"['chunk: 9 th  September 2020  Elizabeth Kendon, Steven Chan, Hayley Fowler, Fai Fung, Jason Lowe, James Murphy, Cath Senior,  Christopher Short, Simon Tucker and Jonathan Wilkinson    Headlines  •   We have found an error within the UKCP Local 2.2km climate model in the computer code  that determines how much of the solid precipitation falls as snow and how much as small ice  pellets.   •   No other UKCP product is affected by the error, and top-level messages from UKCP in terms  of climate change in the UK are unchanged.  •   The existing 2.2km data can still be used for many applications, but extra care is needed in  the use of data for some variables and locations. The variables primarily affected are snow  and winter temperature especially over Scotland, for which the existing 2.2km data should  not be used. Also affected but to a lesser extent are winter precipitation, hourly  precipitation extremes across the UK and wind extremes over the ocean and north-west  coastal regions, and for these variables the existing 2.2km data should be used with caution.  The variables unaffected are summer temperature including extremes and summer mean  precipitation.   •   New data with the error fixed will be issued, with a planned release for Spring 2021.  •   On fixing the error, the simulation of lightning is considerably improved, allowing it to be  potentially provided as a user diagnostic in the new release in 2021.  •   This report is aimed at more technical users of the 2.2km data, providing guidance on when  applications are likely unaffected by the error or where users should wait for the new 2.2km  data.   Summary  An error has been found within the UKCP 2.2km climate model in the scheme that represents graupel,  which are soft small ice pellets with higher densities and fall speeds than snow. Graupel is typically  smaller than hail and forms when supercooled water coats a snowflake. Subsequent testing has shown  that the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections (including for temperature, precipitation and wind) can still  provide important information for many applications related to climate change but there is a need to  update the user guidance on use of the UKCP 2.2km data, with additional caveats. Over the coming  months, we will provide new additional simulations from the UKCP 2.2km climate model with the error  fixed, which should ultimately be treated as the preferred dataset.    The graupel error emerged whilst having a detailed look at simulations performed with the same  version of the model over the Colorado mountains. The error was in the code that controls the  fraction of snow converted to graupel, rather than in the total snow/ice amount, and in general  resulted in too much snow being converted to graupel. In the operational weather forecast model,  graupel is included but the section of erroneous code is turned off, and thus operational weather  forecasts are not impacted. No other UKCP product is affected by the error, and top-level messages  from UKCP in terms of climate change in the UK (Lowe et al 2018) are not impacted.  Some rapid tests have been performed for one 2.2km ensemble member to look at the consequences  of the graupel code error for the UKCP Local simulations.

How did the UKCP18 flaw impact the '81-'00 baseline adjustment for site-specific projections?,"['chunk: In August 2022, an issue was discovered with the UKCP18 processing code, which meant that the  adjustment needed to convert from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth  Assessment Report (AR5) baseline of 1986-2005 to the baseline period of 1981-2000 used in UKCP18  was not fully implemented for the site-specific time-mean sea-level projections. This issue has now been  resolved and sea-level projection datasets updated accordingly. The update results in about a 1 cm (or   0.01 m) increase for all UKCP18 site-specific sea-level projections over all timescales (e.g., projected   sea-level rise at 2030 + 1 cm, projected sea-level rise at 2100 + 1 cm). While this does affect headline  projection ranges at 2100 by + 0.01 m, the change is small and unlikely to be decision relevant. UKCP   users are encouraged to adopt the updated projections where this is practical. The updated data will be   the default version made available via CEDA and the UKCP User Interface from Ma rch 2023. 2. Description of the issue  The UKCP18 time-mean sea-level projection methods are rooted in CMIP5 climate model simulations that  are expressed relative to a baseline period of 1986-2005 (M. Palmer et al., 2018; M. D. Palmer et al., 2020).  It was therefore necessary to apply a small adjustment to these sea-level projections to express them  relative to the 1981-2000 baseline as described in section A1.1.1 of the UKCP18 Marine Report:    “Since the IPCC AR5 GMSL projections were formulated relative to a baseline period of 1986-2005 it is      necessary to carry out a small adjustment to the component time series to provide projections across       UKCP18 for a common baseline period of 1981-2000. This is achieved on the basis of the average       difference between the two baseline periods computed using four tide-gauge reconstructions of GMSL      (Church & White, 2011; Hay et al., 2015; Jevrejeva et al., 2014; Ray & Douglas, 2011). The result is an       offset of +0.011m for the total sea level, which is then applied across components according to the       proportion of sea level change that each accounts for in the first decade of the projections (assuming that     these are representative of the earlier period). These proportions are: 40.5% for Thermal Expansion; 9.5%      for Antarctica; 12.5% for Greenland; 27% for Glaciers and 10.5% for Land Water.”  While this adjustment was successfully applied for the UKCP18 global mean sea level (GMSL) projections,   a flaw in the processing code meant that this adjustment was not carried across to the site-specific UK  sea-level projections.

How does the fixed-code test's significance compare given the graupel error's minor impact on the ensemble's std dev?,"['chunk: al., 2019). There is a tendency for too much small graupel and too little graupel with sizes greater  than 2mm, and, as a consequence, unlike in observations we rarely see graupel at the surface in the  summer or when the surface temperature is approximately 5ᵒC or more in current models. The  UKCP 2.2km CPM is similarly affected by this issue, which acts to lessen the effect of the graupel  code error (discussed above), since it means that the excessive graupel aloft is expected to have  little impact on surface parameters in the summer season (except for lightning activity which is  strongly dependent on graupel).   Results from testing fix to graupel code  The current UKCP 2.2km product consists of an ensemble of 12 simulations run for 3 time periods. In  order to assess the impact of the graupel code error in the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections, tests  have been rapidly performed for one ensemble member (specifically the UKCP 2.2km standard  reference member) where the graupel code error has been eliminated. The standard reference  member is specifically the member where no parameter perturbations were applied to the driving  model (Kendon et al., 2019). Here we present results looking at the impact of the graupel code error  on the present-day biases and projected changes in surface temperature, precipitation, wind and  lightning. 19 years of data are available from the test simulations to date and are reported here, and  we also provide information on the convergence of results from adding more years of data. We also  assess the significance of the impact of the graupel code error by comparing the difference between  the fixed and erro neous runs against the standard deviation across the original UKCP 2.2km 12- member ensemble for each variable. Because all ensemble members are expected to be impacted  similarly to the single-member test, we note that differences smaller than the CPM ensemble  standard deviation could still lead to a systematic shift in the ensemble-mean projection. Here, we  only have results from the single-member test, and use the original CPM ensemble standard  deviation as a benchmark of whether the impact of the graupel code error is greater than  differences we would expect between members. Where the impact of the graupel code error is less  than the standard deviation, i.e. the fixed-code test simulation is within the original ensemble  spread, we judge the impact of the graupel code error to not be significant.  The modified test suite is identical to the UKCP 2.2km CPM (described in Kendon et al., 2019), except  the short-term logical l_fix_mphys_diags_iter is switched from true to false. In this way, we avoid  activating the erroneous auto-conversion calculation, but do not actually fix the code itself (which  has been done for later UM versions) although the effect is the same.  Simulations were set off for  time-slice 1 (1980-2000) and for time-slice 3 (2060-2080) and the results here are reported using the  19 years of data available to date (after the first year of the simulations are discarded as spin-up).  Results here compare present-day performance and future changes for the test CPM with the  graupel code error fixed (CPM_fix) with the original UKCP CPM (CPM_UKCP) and the UKCP RCM, for  all data regridded to a common 12km grid. The same years of data are used from all model runs for a  fair comparison.

"""What were the expected site-specific projection changes post-code correction with a +1.1 cm GMSL adjustment?""","['chunk: The correction needed to the processing code was minimal and involved some simple refactoring of a few  lines so that baseline adjustments applied to the GMSL Monte Carlo data object were explicitly passed  through to the site-specific projections. The code fix was implemented by M.D. Palmer and then  independently checked by T. Howard. Following the refactoring of the code, the UKCP18 sea-level  projections were initially run for the four UK capital cities to check that the differences to the original  projections were consistent with the expected increase of approximately 1 cm, as discussed below. Once  this was confirmed, the code was re-run on all UKCP18 coastal grid boxes and checked against the original  projection data files. Finally, the updated projections were run on two independent software architectures  and the data files were cross-referenced and found to be a perfect match.  Since the baseline adjustment needed for GMSL was +1.1 cm it was anticipated that correction of the  processing code would lead to an approximately +1 cm (or 0.01 m) increase in site-specific projections on  all timescales. However, there is some additional subtlety due to the baseline adjustment being carried out  by individual sea-level components (see quoted text in section 2) and being convolved with the  corresponding spatial patterns of GRD (Gravity, Rotation and solid-earth Deformation, (Gregory et al.,  2019)) and local scaling between global and local expressions of sea-level change simulated by CMIP5  models (e.g., M. D. Palmer et al., 2020). These subtleties result in some small time/space dependence of the  approximate +1 cm offset. At 2100, the differences across all percentiles between the updated and original  UKCP18 projections show a range of about 0.8 cm to 1.3 cm (or 0.008 to 0.013 m, Figure 1).

"""What improvements do UKCP18's RCPs offer over UKCP09's SRES in range analysis?""","['chunk: As knowledge of the climate system improves through research, and also as the observed signal of climate  change increases compared to natural variability we can expect changes in the projected ranges of future  climate.

"What influences CMIP6/UKCP diffs: ensembles, postprocessing, or forcing variations?","['chunk: e.   Summary  Below we compare the UKCP projections and CMIP6 results as alternative datasets available for use  in impacts studies and risk assessments. Several factors are potential drivers of differences in their  projected outcomes:  •   Use of different climate model ensembles (sections 2a-2c), liable to drive different ranges  of projected outcomes through alternative representations of physical drivers of climate  change response (Palmer et al., 2021).   •   Differences in postprocessing strategies to account for model performance (sections 2a, b),  or the absence of such a strategy in the case of CMIP6 models (section 2c), can also drive  differences in ranges of response.  •   Variations in applied radiative forcing (section 2d), arising from (a) differences between the  RCP- and SSP-based concentration pathways (when comparing CMIP5-13 against CMIP6);  (b) use of an emissions-driven concept in UKCP-Probabilistic and GC3.05-PPE, versus a  concentration-driven concept in CMIP5-13 and GC3.05-PPE.  Since our aim is to compare the datasets “as they come” for user applications, we do not  attempt adjustments to account for differences in external forcing. However, in section 4 we present  examples of future UK changes expressed per unit change in GMST, which removes approximately the  globally-averaged influence of contrasts in external forcing and sensitivity of response between the  alternative datasets.         3.

Using GWLs allows the assessment of changes in rainfall when  global temperatures reach, 1.5°C, 2°C and 4°C. Several GWLs are assessed as we do not yet know which  level will be reached as this depends on future greenhouse gas emis sions choices and the sensitivity of   the climate system. Model Uncertainty:  There are two types of model uncertainty – parameter uncertainty  and structural uncertainty. Parameter uncertainty arises from the inability of climate  models to resolve every process within the climate system, requiring the use of physical  equations and parameters. In UKCP, parameter uncertainty is assessed within the Met  Office’s Hadley Centre model (GC3.05-PPE) by perturbing model parameters within  expert-specified ranges to develop a range of simulations of the future climate, called the Perturbed  Parameter Ensemble (PPE). Uncertainty can arise from the structure of the climate model itself which influences how sensitive the  model is to the emission forcings, as well as the spatial and seasonal patterns of change that are  determined by changes in the regional processes or dynamics. This type of uncertainty can be assessed by  using a range of climate models. The UKCP Probabilistic, Global products and Probabilistic Extremes  products use both the Hadley Centre climate model (GC3.05-PPE) and models from CMIP5 (CMIP5-13).   The Hadley Centre model has a higher climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases compared to other models.  The UKCP Regional and Local currently only include downscaled versions of the Hadley Centre climate  model and sample a narrower range of structural uncertainty, however they capture parameter uncertainty  from the PPE. Figure 1 compares seasonal mean changes in precipitation (%) across all UKCP products for  Scotland and England. Changes in summer precipitation in England show a co nsiderable drying trend in the  Local and Regional projections (following the driving GC3.05-PPE), whereas the CMIP5 simulations and the  UKCP Probabilistic projections indicate more modest reductions or small increases in rainfall. It should be  noted that additional UKCP Regional and Local simulations downscaling selected members from CMIP5 will  be made available in 2024. These will provide wider uncertainty context for impacts studies. The  EuroCORDEX-UK project , funded through the UK Climate Resilience Programme, offers a facility to   supplement the UKCP Regional projections with information from a broader range of high-resolution  climate simulations from the EuroCORDEX downscaling experiment.  The additional projections will provide  a more comprehensive sampling of uncertainty in the high resolution UKCP projections.

"""Which UKCP18 model better represents Scotland's winter snow variability?""","['chunk: •  The CPM results largely reinforce results from the RCM in terms of UK seasonal mean changes. One  possible exception is for changes in winter precipitation where the CPM suggests greater increases  compared to the RCM. Research is ongoing to understand the complex drivers behind this, but initial  analysis suggests that projections based on conventional coarser resolution climate models may  underestimate “upper-end” responses in winter mean precipitation (Section 5), although studies with  other CPMs are needed to confirm this. •  For temperature, there is no evidence to suggest that the CPM projections are more or less plausible  than those from the RCM. In some cases there are differences in the projections between the models,  notably for temperature changes over Scotland in winter. In this case, although the CPM gives better  agreement with observations, it has a less sophisticated treatment of lying snow, and so we do not have  greater confidence in its projections. Thus for temperature changes, we recommend usage of   information from Strand 1 and 2 given the more comprehensive view of uncertainties, except where fine  spatial detail is required. •  The CPM projections are expected to be the primary source of information for users interested in daily  rainfall extremes in summer or changes on hourly timescales. For these the CPM projections are  considered more plausible, due to the better representation of convection and local processes in storms  in the CPM. However, there are still deficiencies, as many convective storms occur on scales smaller than  2.2km in reality. Further research is needed to assess the importance of these deficiencies for future  projections. Projections of hourly rainfall change from conventional climate models are unreliable.  Coarser resolution models also likely underestimate increases in summer rainfall intensity, with  implications for flood risk assessment. •  The CPM is expected to better represent changes over cities, due to the higher spatial resolution and use  of a more sophisticated urban scheme, although more work is needed to confirm this. Also over  mountains and coastlines, the added spatial detail provided by the CPM may be important for some  users. •  We have confidence that the UKCP18 projections provide significant improvements on UKCP09, and  additions of new capability. Nevertheless, there are still limitations in our ability to project 21st century  weather and climate. For example, although the CPM provides a big step forward in representing small  scale behaviour in the real atmosphere, there are still deficiencies. Also all projections are conditioned on  the chosen scenario of future greenhouse gas emissions (RCP8.5) and the particular models and  methodologies we employ in UKCP18.

The differences between the RCM and CPM are mainly due to the differences in the way the models simulate  snowfall and the improved representation of topography in the CPM (see Kendon et al, 2019a, Section 3.5  for further details). In the updated Local 2.2km projections (released July 2021), there is a much improved  representation of snowfall and lying snow at the surface compared to the original Local 2.2km projections  (released September 2019). In general this leads to greater consistency between the CPM and RCM. The updated Local (2.2km) model produces more snowfall over the Scottish mountains and less in the  vicinity of the northwest coastline of Scotland compared to the RCM. There is also more lying snow over high  ground in Scotland in the CPM. These differences are likely explained by the higher resolution of the CPM  leading to a better representation of mountains, and the ability of the CPM to better represent the  movement of convective showers inland. Therefore, the Local (2.2km) projections provide the best  information available on snow in the UKCP suite of products, due to the better representation of topography  and wintertime convective showers. What do you need to be aware of? This factsheet details the biases in the data, though direct comparison with observations is difficult. Users  should be aware that both the Regional (12km) and Local (2.2km) projections underestimate uncertainties,  as they only downscale versions of the Met Office Hadley Centre model. Although the local projections can provide information on small-scale weather events in the future, they  should not be confused with an operational weather forecast, which provides information on weather that is  likely to be experienced in the next few days. Instead the local projections provide a set of plausible projections  of climate change for the UK, if we follow a high emission scenario (i.e. RCP8.5). In particular, they provide  information on the local effects of changes in the types of weather that may be experienced in the future.  The local projections sample a narrower range of potential future outcomes than the full set of global  projections. In particular, the regional climate models only downscale 12 members of the PPE-15 (and are in  turn downscaled using the CPM) and none of the CMIP5-13.

What do UKCP18's projections suggest about future climates?,"['chunk: We have designed the probabilistic projections to provide the primary tool for assessments of the ranges of  uncertainties in UKCP18. However, they may not capture all possible future outcomes. The set of global and UK future climates has limited sizes and whilst it does cover a range of futures (with  the Met Office set of global models providing the higher end of future global temperatures), it cannot  simulate every possible future climate. This is especially true of the regional model (and consequently the  convection-permitting model used in the local (2.2km) projections) which is not driven by any climate  model simulations that fed into IPCC AR5 (i.e. CMIP5 climate models). Neither the set based on global  models, or that based on regional and convection-permitting models have been designed to support  estimates of the relative likelihood of alternative outcomes within their ranges of response, nor have they  been constructed to replicate the probabilistic projections.  The 21 st  century surge and wave projections are based upon relatively small set of CMIP5 models. It is  unlikely that these simulations span the full range of CMIP5 model responses under climate change. In  particular, these projections should be viewed as indicative of the overall magnitude of changes we might see  over the 21 st  Century.  For both the surge and wave projections, we are unable to quantify the relative  influence of the climate change signal and natural variability on the simulated changes over the 21 st  Century. 5.  How to use the UKCP18 probabilistic projections and what   they represent The future probabilistic projections in UKCP18 are an update of those produced for UKCP09. You should  interpret the probabilities as being an indication of how much the evidence from models and observations  taken together in our methodology support a particular future climate outcome.  The relative probabilities indicate how strongly the evidence from models and observations, taken together  in our methodology, support alternative future climate outcomes. There is more evidence for outcomes  near the centre of the distribution than in the tails, so we see unimodal (single-peaked) distributions. In  these, the relative probabilities for specific outcomes are typically much higher near the 50% cumulative  probability level (median) of the distribution, than for outcomes lying either below the 10% cumulative  probability level or above the 90% cumulative probability level. As mentioned above, the probabilities are conditioned on methodological choices and expert judgement.  The results may change if a different methodology is used.

This document aims to provide these  overall messages based on what we know already from UKCP, as well as what we know from the wider  scientific literature, and offers guidance on where to find more information. It focusses on strong winds and  windstorms and briefly includes thunder and lightning; please see separate guidance about rainfall.  Another area where additional information was requested was combined hazards; that is, where more than  one weather hazard occurs at the same time (e.g. wind-driven rain) or in quick succession (e.g. a dry period  followed by thunderstorms).

In this document, we focus on the two types of storm that affect the UK (Figure 1): large-scale low pressure  systems or windstorms, that bring rain and wind over hundreds of kilometres and can last for a few days;  and smaller-scale thunderstorms with hazards possibly including rain, hail, lightning and tornadoes affecting  a few kilometres for a few hours.

Here we analyze the performance of climate models published between 1970 and 2007 in projecting future global mean surface temperature (GMST) changes. Models are compared to observations based on both the change in GMST over time and the change in GMST over the change in external forcing. The latter approach accounts for mismatches in model forcings, a potential source of error in model projections independent of the accuracy of model physics. We ﬁnd that climate models published over the past ﬁve decades were skillful in predicting subsequent GMST changes, with most models examined showing warming consistent with observations, particularly when mismatches between model‐projected and observationally estimated forcings were taken into account.

In this paper we undertake a thorough evaluation of the performance of various climate models published between the early 1970s and the late 2000s. Speciﬁcally, we look at how well models project global warming in the years after they were published by comparing them to observed temperature changes. Model projections rely on two things to accurately match observations: accurate modeling of climate physics and accurate assumptions around future emissions of CO 2  and other factors affecting the climate. The best physics‐based model will still be inaccurate if it is driven by future changes in emissions that differ from reality. To account for this, we look at how the relationship between temperature and atmospheric CO 2  (and other climate drivers) differs between models and observations. We ﬁnd that climate models published over the past ﬁve decades were generally quite  accurate in predicting global warming in the years after publication, particularly when accounting for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric CO 2  and other climate drivers. This research should help resolve public confusion around the performance of past climate modeling efforts and increases our conﬁdence that models are accurately projecting global warming. 1. Introduction Physics‐based models provide an important tool to assess changes in the Earth's climate due to external forcing and internal variability (e.g., Arrhenius, 1896; IPCC, 2013). However, evaluating the performance of these models can be challenging. While models are commonly evaluated by comparing “hindcasts” of prior climate variables to historical observations, the development of hindcast simulations is not always independent from the tuning of parameters that govern unresolved physics (Gettelman et al., 2019; Mauritsen et al., 2019; Schmidt et al., 2017). There has been relatively little work evaluating the performance of climate model projections over their future projection period (referred to hereafter as model projections), as much of the research tends to focus on the latest generation of modeling results (Eyring et al., 2019). ©2019. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Many different sets of climate projections have been produced over the past several decades. The ﬁrst time series projections of future temperatures were computed using simple energy balance models in the early 1970s, most of which were solely constrained by a projected external forcing time series (originally, CO 2  con- centrations) and an estimate of equilibrium climate sensitivity from single‐column radiative‐convective equilibrium models (e.g., Manabe & Wetherald, 1967) or general circulation models (e.g., Manabe & Wetherald, 1975).

How does GMSL adjustment impact UKCP18 projections by 2100?,"['chunk: The correction needed to the processing code was minimal and involved some simple refactoring of a few  lines so that baseline adjustments applied to the GMSL Monte Carlo data object were explicitly passed  through to the site-specific projections. The code fix was implemented by M.D. Palmer and then  independently checked by T. Howard. Following the refactoring of the code, the UKCP18 sea-level  projections were initially run for the four UK capital cities to check that the differences to the original  projections were consistent with the expected increase of approximately 1 cm, as discussed below. Once  this was confirmed, the code was re-run on all UKCP18 coastal grid boxes and checked against the original  projection data files. Finally, the updated projections were run on two independent software architectures  and the data files were cross-referenced and found to be a perfect match.  Since the baseline adjustment needed for GMSL was +1.1 cm it was anticipated that correction of the  processing code would lead to an approximately +1 cm (or 0.01 m) increase in site-specific projections on  all timescales. However, there is some additional subtlety due to the baseline adjustment being carried out  by individual sea-level components (see quoted text in section 2) and being convolved with the  corresponding spatial patterns of GRD (Gravity, Rotation and solid-earth Deformation, (Gregory et al.,  2019)) and local scaling between global and local expressions of sea-level change simulated by CMIP5  models (e.g., M. D. Palmer et al., 2020). These subtleties result in some small time/space dependence of the  approximate +1 cm offset. At 2100, the differences across all percentiles between the updated and original  UKCP18 projections show a range of about 0.8 cm to 1.3 cm (or 0.008 to 0.013 m, Figure 1). For the  exploratory extended UKCP18 projections at 2300, the range is a bout 0.4 cm to 1.8 cm (or 0.004 to   0.018 m, not shown).

"""How does PoT improve sample size and event capture vs. block maxima?""","['chunk: Extreme value theory (e.g. Coles, 2001) is used in climate research to derive probability distributions that  describe the expected occurrence of rare events (e.g. IPCC, 2012). Such events lie in the far upper or lower  tails of the full distribution of values for the relevant variable, for example daily temperature maxima that  occur less than once or twice per season. Using EV distributions compensates for sampling issues, by  supporting estimates of probability for events that may not be present in the relatively short periods of data  used to calibrate the distributions. A key assumption is that the chosen EV distribution provides an accurate  representation of the complete probability distribution of the relevant events.  Alternative approaches are available to estimate parameters of EV distributions. The block maximum  method involves using the most extreme value within each of a set of distinct blocks of data. Here, we  provide projections for the meteorological seasons (December to February, March to May, June to August  and September to November). For summer, for example, this would involve picking the highest value of TXx,  Rx1day or Rx5day from each summer over a set of consecutive years.  This method has been used in  conjunction with the generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution in several climate change papers,  including the Brown et al. (2014) study that forms the basis of our approach here. It has the advantage of  avoiding the need to select a threshold to define an extreme event, but restricts the size of the data sample  to one event per season. In the present application, therefore, we use an alternative method: peaks over threshold (PoT). This  involves using all events exceeding a specified threshold in a given season, thus considering more of the  data, and avoiding the risk of missing multiple extremes that may occur in close proximity. The PoT  approach also excludes any seasons which happen not to contain any extreme events. The results depend  on the choice of threshold, which is a subjective decision. We select thresholds designed to capture 3% of  events per season, thus seeking a balance between increasing sample size and capturing genuine extremes.  Following Brown et al. (2008), the number of events is assumed to follow a Poisson process, and the  magnitude of exceedances a generalised Pareto distribution (e.g. Katz et al., 2002). The expected number of exceedances above a level x, conditional on x exceeding the chosen threshold, is  parameterised as: (1) where  µ ,  σ  and  ξ  are the location, scale and shape parameters (e.g. Coles, 2001).

How do UKCP-Global and CMIP6 compare in terms of biases and performance?,"['chunk: e.   Summary   The evaluation diagnostics of sections 3b-d demonstrate an overall level of performance from the  UKCP-Global simulations that is competitive with the CMIP6 ensemble. Both sets of simulations exhibit a  range of biases across their individual members, with evidence of a systematic component to the biases  for some variables. The results also demonstrate potential to identify a subset of the most skilful CMIP6  models that could contribute to an improved UKCP-Global dataset in the future.         4.  Comparison of CMIP6 and UKCP projections: Future changes  a.   Future changes in global mean surface temperature   Figure 11 (bottom panel) shows projected future changes to 2100 for annual GMST (relative to  1900-1930), comparing UKCP-Global results for RCP8.5 with 38 CMIP6 projections for SSP5-8.5, a  scenario with similar total radiative forcing by 2100 (section 2d). Neither set of projections is formally  constrained by historical GMST changes (see section 3d), though their status differs through application  of climatology-based screening to select UKCP-Global but not CMIP6 members (section 2b cf 2c).  Both  sets of projections provide a broad range of changes that grows with time as the applied forcing and  modelled responses develop through the 21 st  century. By 2100, the combined set of changes (across all  66 simulations) ranges from ~3.0-8.0°C, with a central estimate of ~5.0°C.', 'chunk: a.   Evaluation of UKCP18 and CMIP6 historical simulations   We revisited the set of global coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations included in the UKCP-Global  component of UKCP18, using the CMIP6 ensemble as a new comparative benchmark. Despite the  general improvements in CMIP6 models compared to CMIP5, the historical performance of UKCP-Global  simulations is competitive with CMIP6 models. This applies to seasonal climatologies of surface air  temperature and precipitation, in which systematic regional biases in CMIP6 are similar to those in the  perturbed parameter and multi-model ensembles contributing members to UKCP-Global (see section  2b). The same applies to annual climatologies for a broader set of climate variables, particularly in the  case of the perturbed parameter ensemble (GC3.05-PPE). The PPE is derived from a model closely  related to HadGEM3-GC3.1, the configuration contributed by the Met Office to the CMIP6 ensemble.  Three major modes of coupled-ocean-atmosphere variability (ENSO, AMV and winter NAO), all of  which exert important influences on European climate, were also evaluated.  All UKCP-Global and most  CMIP6 simulations exceed the observed amplitude of interannual variations in NAO. For AMV, all CMIP6  members simulate greater interannual variability than observed, while UKCP-Global members exhibit a  range of biases of either sign. Observed and simulated estimates are subject to significant sampling  uncertainties across different periods, so in many cases the simulation biases are not statistically  significant. However, some models do show ranges of variability that fail to overlap with observations,  especially for some CMIP6 simulations of AMV. A caveat is that AMV exhibits significant variability on  the centennial time scale (Mavilia et al., 2018), limiting the extent to which firm conclusions can be  drawn from the 1900-2005 time series considered here. For ENSO amplitude (measured using monthly  anomalies in the NINO3.4 index), uncertainty ranges from all but one UKCP-Global members overlap  substantially with observations. This is also true for many CMIP6 members, though a minority simulate  ENSO variability that is clearly too low or too large.  By the most recent decade (2010-2020), the observed change in global mean surface temperature  (GMST) relative to 1900-1930 amounts to ~1.0°C. This lies near the middle of the distributions simulated  by the CMIP6 and UKCP-Global ensembles, whose ranges of change are similar. During 1960-1990, most  GC3.05-PPE members and some CMIP6 members simulate GMST anomalies cooler than observations,  due at least partly to strong negative forcing from anthropogenic aerosol emissions. However, most  GC3.05-PPE simulations warm more rapidly than observations beyond 1990, removing the earlier cool  bias by the 2010s.          In this report CMIP6 data was assembled for evaluation on a simple “one-model-one-vote” basis.  In contrast, members of UKCP-Global were selected from wider sets of CMIP5 models and GC3.05  perturbed parameter variants, through application of screening criteria to identify a subset of high- quality simulations offering a diversity of projected future changes. Our CMIP6 evaluation suggests that']","UKCP-Global and CMIP6 both exhibit a range of biases across their individual members, with evidence of a systematic component to the biases for some variables.

What limits consistency in surge and wave projections using CMIP5 and Euro-CORDEX?,"['chunk: •  The 21 st  century surge and wave projections are based upon relatively small CMIP5 model ensembles. It  is unlikely that these simulations span the full range of CMIP5 model responses under climate change.  These projections should be viewed as indicative of the overall magnitude of changes we might see over  the 21 st  century. For both these sets of simulations, we cannot be sure of the relative influence of the  climate change signal vs natural variability.  •  The extended time-mean sea level projections have much lower confidence than the 21 st  century  projections. These projections can be considered as sensitivity studies and should not be interpreted as  showing the full range of post-2100 behaviour, or the most likely behaviour. The potential for additional  sea level rise from Antarctic dynamic ice discharge is even more uncertain on these time horizons, with  some studies suggesting several additional metres of rise by 2300 under RCP8.5.  •  The simulations of changes in tide and surge characteristics make the simple assumption of a fixed  coastline under all levels of future sea level rise. However, several global tide model studies (e.g. Pickering  et al, 2017) find that tidal changes are very sensitive to coastal management practices. Thus, the  findings presented here need to be interpreted as illustrative of potential changes. Further work is  needed under more realistic model configurations to make progress in this research avenue.  •  One of the limitations of the storm surge and waves projections presented in this report was the  availability of high frequency CMIP5 climate model output needed to drive surge and wave model  simulations. The storm surge projections (presented in section 3.2) made use of dynamically downscaled  data provided as part of the Euro-CORDEX project. Only a handful of Euro-CORDEX simulations had the  high frequency surface wind and pressure data required to drive the storm surge model. The wave  projections (presented in section 3.4) were limited to existing global and regional wave model  simulations that had already been carried out as part the EU RISES-AM and COWCLIP projects. It was  not possible to include the GFDL-ESM2M model (which provides our largest increase in the atmospheric  drivers of surge) among our wave simulations. This limited the degree of consistency we were able to  achieve across the surge and wave modelling components and resulted in model ensembles that are  much  smaller than for the time-mean sea level projections. •  The primary effect of mean sea level increase on waves is to increase the mean height around which the  waves fluctuate, leading to increased over-topping and coastal flooding. An important secondary inshore  effect arises as follows. The maximum amplitude of waves before breaking in shallow water is limited by  the water depth. Thus, an increase in mean sea level will in general have the secondary effect of moving  the surf zone further inshore, increasing the wave energy available at the coast for over-topping and  coastal erosion, thereby exacerbating the primary effect. Users should be aware that we do not assess  this secondary inshore effect here: our assessment of changes in the wave climate focusses on offshore  wave changes.    Finally, all users need to be aware that as our understanding of the climate system and our ability to model  it improves, and as computing power increases, it is likely that future projections will be refined. A  consequence of these expected improvements is that both the climate model projections and probability  distribution for a given outcome are likely to evolve in the future.

How do HadGEM3 PPE's projections stack up against CMIP5 MME's?,"['chunk: The marine projections presented in UKCP18 are rooted in the multi-model-ensemble (MME) simulations  provided as part of the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5; Taylor et al, 2012)  and used in the IPCC 5 th  Assessment Report (e.g. Church et al, 2013). They do not use the HadGEM3  perturbed physics ensemble (PPE) that forms part of the of the UKCP18 land projections. This decision was  taken for two reasons: (i) evidence from previous work suggested that the PPE would not capture the full  range of sea level rise responses seen across CMIP5 models (Pardaens et al, 2011; Figure 6.1.1); (ii) the  scheduling of the HadGEM3 PPE simulations did not allow sufficient time to develop sea level projections  based upon those simulations. In this section we present a comparison of climate projections from CMIP5  MME and the HadGEM3 PPE for key metrics relevant to time-mean sea level, surges and waves, to establish  the relationships between these two model ensembles.   6�1 Metrics relevant to time-mean sea level change The UKCP18 time-mean sea level projections are fundamentally built upon CMIP5 model simulations of  global mean surface temperature (GMST) and global thermal expansion (section A1.1). While global surface  temperature is readily available from climate model simulations, global thermal expansion is not always  routinely output. However, global thermal expansion is closely related to the magnitude of Earth’s top-of- atmosphere radiation imbalance, via the associated changes in total ocean heat content (e.g. Kuhlbrodt and  Gregory, 2012; Lorbacher et al, 2015; von Schuckmann et al, 2016). Therefore, we focus our comparisons  on changes in GMST and Earth’s top-of-atmosphere net radiation.  The HadGEM3 PPE shows a surface warming of GMST in the late 21 st  century that typically exceeds the  90% confidence interval of the CMIP5 models used in the UKCP18 time-mean sea level projections (Figure  6.1.1, left), consistent with the findings in the Land Report. However, we can see that the CMIP5 models  used to supplement the HadGEM3 PPE in the land projections are well-distributed across the CMIP5 MME  used in the UKCP18 sea level projections. This means there is little expectation of bias from differences in  the choice of CMIP5 members. Comparisons of changes in the net radiation at top-of-atmosphere under  RCP8.5 (Figure 6.1.1, right) show that the HadGEM3 PPE projections are above the CMIP5 MME average,  but the two ensembles have a much greater degree of overlap than for GMST. In general, the larger rises in  GMST will tend to promote greater levels of sea level rise (Church et al, 2013). Similarly, larger increases in  Earth’s net radiative imbalance are directly associa ted with greater increases in global ocean heat uptake  and sea level rise through ocean expansion. Overall, we would expect the climate change signals seen in the  HadGEM3 PPE simulations to be associated with global and regional sea level rise that is towards the upper  end of the 90% confidence intervals of the RCP8.5 projections presented in section 3.1.

What uncertainties do UKCP18 projections face with transient vs. stabilized warming levels?,"['chunk: Additional caveats and limitations come with:  •  Derived projections. •  Extended exploratory time-mean sea level projections.  •  Tide and surge simulations. The derived projections over UK land areas use approximate methods to produce an estimate of RCP2.6  and global warming levels of 2 and 4 ° C (compared to pre-industrial). This introduces additional  uncertainties. One of the major assumptions is that we can use the climate model time series that reach  particular warming levels through the 21 st  century (transient) to inform a future that has reached a steady  warming level (stabilized). There is some evidence that future climate outcomes at a particular global  warming level can differ depending on whether that warming level is transient or stabilized (e.g. Ceppi et al,  2018). See UKCP18 Derived Scenarios Report (Gohar et al, 2018).  The extended exploratory time-mean sea level projections have much lower confidence than the 21 st   Century Projections. Consider these projections as sensitivity studies and do not interpret them as showing  the full range of post-2100 behaviour, or the most likely behaviour. The potential for additional sea level rise  from Antarctic dynamic ice discharge is even more uncertain on these time horizons, with some studies  suggesting several additional metres of rise by 2300 under RCP8.5.  The simulations of changes in tide and surge characteristics make the simple assumption of a fixed  coastline under all levels of future sea level rise.  10.  Take care when comparing/combining variables When carrying out analyses that consider more than one variable, ensure that any outcomes are consistent  and coherent in their representation of the changes. For the probabilistic projections, there is no spatial  coherence. For the global, regional, local and derived projections ensure that you choose variables from the  same member of the set of projections. For example, summer temperature from one member is unlikely to  be consistent with precipitation from another. Choosing a model based on being amongst the largest of the probabilistic climate changes in summer  does not necessarily translate into the same model being in such an extreme position in the winter  change results.

How does CMIP6's warm bias in marine stratocumulus compare to UKCP-Global's?,"['chunk: Abstract    The CMIP6 ensemble continues a trend of steady improvement through successive phases of  Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) multi-model experiments. We compare CMIP6  simulations against those of UKCP-Global, a component of the 2018 release of the UK Climate  Projections (UKCP18). UKCP-Global consists of a screened subset of CMIP5 models combined with a  perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) based on the Met Office HadGEM3-GC3.05 model. Overall, we  assess the CMIP6 and UKCP-Global ensembles to be similar in quality, based on multivariate  climatological averages, three major modes of coupled ocean-atmosphere variability and historical  changes in global average surface temperature. Each individual simulation exhibits a range of variable- specific errors, none standing out as clearly superior to the others. Some errors (e.g. a systematic warm  bias in marine stratocumulus regions) are common to both ensembles. During 2010-2020 the observed  global warming (of ~1.0°C since 1900-1930) lies near the middle of the CMIP6 and UKCP-Global ranges.  However, most PPE members and some CMIP6 models are cooler than observations during 1960-1990,  due partly to strong aerosol forcing.  Projected changes for Scotland and England are compared for the fossil-fuel intensive RCP8.5 and  SSP5-8.5 emissions scenarios and the strong mitigation scenarios RCP2.6 and SSP1-2.6. The CMIP6  ensemble confirms the main features of the distributions of surface temperature and precipitation  changes projected by UKCP-Global and UKCP-Probabilistic (the probabilistic projections component of  UKCP18), although some notable differences are also found. By the 2070s, all three sets of projections  show central estimates of warming that are larger in summer than in winter, in England than in  Scotland, and under intensive compared with mitigated greenhouse gas forcing. However, few CMIP6  simulations lie within the lowest 25% of winter warming outcomes projected by UKCP-Probabilistic for  Scotland.  All precipitation distributions show signals for increase in winter that are confident under strong  forcing (likelihood ~90%) and reasonably confident (likelihood ~75%) under mitigated forcing. In  summer, drying is projected to be more likely than not for both countries and scenarios, with the  exception that CMIP6 indicates no preferred sign for Scotland under low emissions. For England, the  intensity of summer rainfall reductions at the dry end of the distributions is somewhat less pronounced  in CMIP6 than in the UKCP datasets, under the high emissions scenarios.     Neither CMIP6 nor UKCP-Global produces a preferred sign for future changes in the winter North  Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). However, studies of daily weather regimes report shifts towards cyclonic or  zonal types at the expense of anticyclonic patterns, in both datasets. UKCP-Global (but not CMIP6)  favours a future shift to the positive phase of the summer NAO, arising mainly from the PPE simulations.

"""How does PoT improve sample size and event capture vs. block maxima?""","['chunk: Extreme value theory (e.g. Coles, 2001) is used in climate research to derive probability distributions that  describe the expected occurrence of rare events (e.g. IPCC, 2012). Such events lie in the far upper or lower  tails of the full distribution of values for the relevant variable, for example daily temperature maxima that  occur less than once or twice per season. Using EV distributions compensates for sampling issues, by  supporting estimates of probability for events that may not be present in the relatively short periods of data  used to calibrate the distributions. A key assumption is that the chosen EV distribution provides an accurate  representation of the complete probability distribution of the relevant events.  Alternative approaches are available to estimate parameters of EV distributions. The block maximum  method involves using the most extreme value within each of a set of distinct blocks of data. Here, we  provide projections for the meteorological seasons (December to February, March to May, June to August  and September to November). For summer, for example, this would involve picking the highest value of TXx,  Rx1day or Rx5day from each summer over a set of consecutive years.  This method has been used in  conjunction with the generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution in several climate change papers,  including the Brown et al. (2014) study that forms the basis of our approach here. It has the advantage of  avoiding the need to select a threshold to define an extreme event, but restricts the size of the data sample  to one event per season. In the present application, therefore, we use an alternative method: peaks over threshold (PoT). This  involves using all events exceeding a specified threshold in a given season, thus considering more of the  data, and avoiding the risk of missing multiple extremes that may occur in close proximity. The PoT  approach also excludes any seasons which happen not to contain any extreme events. The results depend  on the choice of threshold, which is a subjective decision. We select thresholds designed to capture 3% of  events per season, thus seeking a balance between increasing sample size and capturing genuine extremes.  Following Brown et al. (2008), the number of events is assumed to follow a Poisson process, and the  magnitude of exceedances a generalised Pareto distribution (e.g. Katz et al., 2002). The expected number of exceedances above a level x, conditional on x exceeding the chosen threshold, is  parameterised as: (1) where  µ ,  σ  and  ξ  are the location, scale and shape parameters (e.g. Coles, 2001). With this choice of  formulation, the above EV parameters are equivalent to those used in the GEV distribution for block maxima.  We therefore use the same notation as Brown et al (2014), but using threshold exceedances rather than  block maxima to calibrate the parameters.

The only difference in the GMSL projections used in UKCP18 is that we update  the estimate of the sea level contribution from Antarctic ice dynamics following the work of Levermann et  al, (2014). In this section we present a brief synopsis of the AR5 methods and provide a comparison with  the UKCP18 GMSL projections for the 21 st  century. We refer the reader to Church et al, (2013) and the  associated supplementary materials (available at  http://www.climatechange2013.org/report/full-report/ )  for a more complete discussion.  The GMSL projections presented in AR5 (Church et al, 2013) include estimates of the contribution from: (i)  ocean thermal expansion; (ii) mass changes in the Greenland Ice Sheet; (iii) mass changes in the Antarctic  Ice Sheet; (iv) mass changes in other ice caps and glaciers; (v) changes in sea level related to projections of  groundwater extraction and reservoir impoundment. The ice sheet terms are further broken down into a  contribution from surface mass balance and a contribution from ice dynamics, resulting in a total of seven  individual components of GMSL change. There were three major advances in the sea level science reported  in AR5 compared to the previous IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4, Bindoff et al, 2007). The first was  the demonstration of closure of the GMSL budget, i.e. the summation of observation-based estimates of  terms (i) - (v) was consistent with an independent estimate of GMSL change based on a tide-gauge  reconstruction for the period 1971-2008 (Church et  al, 2011). The second was the demonstration of better  agreement between process-based model estimates of GMSL change and observations. The third was the  inclusion of scenario-independent estimates of the contribution from ice dynamics (i.e. changes in the flow  of ice into the ocean) for both Greenland and Antarctica, which led to systematically larger GMSL  projections than were reported in IPCC AR4, as discussed by Palmer et al, (2016). The AR5 processed-based GMSL projections are based upon the output of 21 CMIP5 (Taylor et al, 2012)  global climate models under the Representative Concentration Pathway climate change scenarios (RCPs;  Meinshausen et al, 2011).

How does mean % change in precipitation influence projection choice?,"['chunk: •  The mean percentage change in precipitation for the period 2070-2099 (Tend) is calculated for each of  the scaled percent realizations. •  If Tend<-30%, scaled log is selected; if Tend>+30%, scaled percent is selected.  •  For Tend in the range [-30, +30] the two choices are randomly sampled, assuming the probability for  scaled percent increases linearly from 0 to 1 within this range 5 . •  For each scaled log realization selected, if any of its individual annual anomalies are substantially outside  the range of RCM data, the scaled percent projection is used instead. The maximum permissible value is  defined as the maximum projected anomaly in the scaled percent projections. This is somewhat higher  than the range of RCM data, since it includes sampled statistical uncertainty (Appendix B). Figure 2.5a shows an example of a single realization in which the scaled log projection is selected, due to  a strong reduction in precipitation of -55% by the end of the century. Figure 2.5b shows a different  realization for the same grid-point, month and emissions scenario.

"""How does Local (2.2km) improve UKCP18's tools with detailed data?""","['chunk: The new Local (2.2km) provides the most physically realistic projections of extremes in local areas for  the coming decades and gives access to sub-daily information.  But, like the Regional (12km), Local (2.2km)  projections span a narrower range of uncertainty compared to the Global (60km) projections. Therefore, we  advise using the Local (2.2km) projections in parallel with other products in the UKCP18 toolkit. 1.8 The new UKCP Local (2.2km) provides, for the first time, national climate change information on a  similar resolution to that of current operational weather forecast models.  Local (2.2km) allows us to  simulate better the type of small-scale behaviour seen in the real atmosphere, including atmospheric  convection 2 , as well as the influence of mountains, coastlines and urban areas. Locally relevant information  can help to inform decision-making on future climate change, to enhance resilience, and adds further  capability to the UKCP18 suite of climate projection tools. 1.9 The new Local (2.2km) projections provide output at hourly scales which is needed for some user  applications, better informing future risk assessments.  Local (2.2km) provides data at kilometre and  hourly scales that can be directly fed into impact models and local decision-making tools. For example,  hourly rainfall data can be used to inform future changes in surface water flood risk for urban flood  management schemes and contingency planners. Data on future extreme heat can be used for decision- making around key infrastructure including bridges, trainlines and thermal performance of buildings. 1.10 Climate science is continually advancing.  We can expect new results to emerge during the coming years  from observations, and from new generations of global, regional and local climate models.

What limits consistency in surge and wave projections using CMIP5 and Euro-CORDEX?,"['chunk: •  The 21 st  century surge and wave projections are based upon relatively small CMIP5 model ensembles. It  is unlikely that these simulations span the full range of CMIP5 model responses under climate change.  These projections should be viewed as indicative of the overall magnitude of changes we might see over  the 21 st  century. For both these sets of simulations, we cannot be sure of the relative influence of the  climate change signal vs natural variability.  •  The extended time-mean sea level projections have much lower confidence than the 21 st  century  projections. These projections can be considered as sensitivity studies and should not be interpreted as  showing the full range of post-2100 behaviour, or the most likely behaviour. The potential for additional  sea level rise from Antarctic dynamic ice discharge is even more uncertain on these time horizons, with  some studies suggesting several additional metres of rise by 2300 under RCP8.5.  •  The simulations of changes in tide and surge characteristics make the simple assumption of a fixed  coastline under all levels of future sea level rise. However, several global tide model studies (e.g. Pickering  et al, 2017) find that tidal changes are very sensitive to coastal management practices. Thus, the  findings presented here need to be interpreted as illustrative of potential changes. Further work is  needed under more realistic model configurations to make progress in this research avenue.  •  One of the limitations of the storm surge and waves projections presented in this report was the  availability of high frequency CMIP5 climate model output needed to drive surge and wave model  simulations. The storm surge projections (presented in section 3.2) made use of dynamically downscaled  data provided as part of the Euro-CORDEX project. Only a handful of Euro-CORDEX simulations had the  high frequency surface wind and pressure data required to drive the storm surge model. The wave  projections (presented in section 3.4) were limited to existing global and regional wave model  simulations that had already been carried out as part the EU RISES-AM and COWCLIP projects. It was  not possible to include the GFDL-ESM2M model (which provides our largest increase in the atmospheric  drivers of surge) among our wave simulations. This limited the degree of consistency we were able to  achieve across the surge and wave modelling components and resulted in model ensembles that are  much  smaller than for the time-mean sea level projections. •  The primary effect of mean sea level increase on waves is to increase the mean height around which the  waves fluctuate, leading to increased over-topping and coastal flooding. An important secondary inshore  effect arises as follows. The maximum amplitude of waves before breaking in shallow water is limited by  the water depth. Thus, an increase in mean sea level will in general have the secondary effect of moving  the surf zone further inshore, increasing the wave energy available at the coast for over-topping and  coastal erosion, thereby exacerbating the primary effect. Users should be aware that we do not assess  this secondary inshore effect here: our assessment of changes in the wave climate focusses on offshore  wave changes.    Finally, all users need to be aware that as our understanding of the climate system and our ability to model  it improves, and as computing power increases, it is likely that future projections will be refined. A  consequence of these expected improvements is that both the climate model projections and probability  distribution for a given outcome are likely to evolve in the future.

"""How do RCM and CPM precip changes vary with orography?""","['chunk: •  1) Influence of baseline.  In the present-day, winter mean precipitation is higher in the RCM than CPM  over land and the coastal sea areas (although winter mean precipitation is lower over the North Atlantic  to the northwest of the UK). This is linked to precipitation being more frequent in the parameterised  convection model, with many fewer dry days/hours (Section 3.4). Given that total precipitation is higher  in the RCM than in the CPM, processes leading to the local formation of precipitation must act more in  the RCM (since the same moisture is being advected in through the lateral boundaries), with higher  evaporation rates over sea in the RCM (Table 4.1). This is also true in the future climate, although with  smaller relative differences between the models. In future, the greater increase in winter mean  precipitation in the CPM over land is due to a greater increase in precipitation occurrence (Section 4.3),  as well as a greater increase in the contribution from intense  precipitation events (see point 2 below).  Given the large number of wet days/hours in the baseline climate in the RCM, there is less scope for this  to increase in the future (c.f. Figs 5.2 and 5.3 for relationship between present-day biases and future  changes for seasonal mean precipitation). Indeed, we find that the number of wet days/hours over land  actually decreases in the RCM in future over the eastern side of the UK (Section 4.3), in part offsetting  the increased precipitation over the western side associated with orography (see point 2). •  2) Role of orography   The largest precipitation events (in terms of hourly or daily accumulations) mostly  occur over orography in winter. It is these large events which are the main contributors to the total  precipitation (rather than the much more numerous light events) and which show the largest future  changes in actual contribution to total precipitation (Section 4.4). In the RCM it rains much more  frequently over orography, with a tendency for too much continuous generation of rain over the  mountains (Section 3.3, Fig 3.3.4). The CPM does not rain as frequently (although when it does, it does so  with greater intensity), leading to lower mean precipitation on the upslopes in the present-day (Section  3.2). Given the more frequent nature of orographic precipitation in the RCM in the present-day, there is  less scope for this to increase in future. In addition, the increases in precipitation contribution from the  highest intensities over orography in future are greater in t he CPM than RCM (Section 4.4).

"""Which model better predicts UK highland snow, RCM or CPM?""","['chunk: •  Both models represent the spatial variability well across the UK in winter  (i.e. greater snowfall in northern and highland areas). •  The winter-to-winter temporal variability in falling snow is better represented in the RCM. •  The winter-to-winter temporal variability in lying snow is better represented in the CPM. The differences between the RCM and CPM are mainly due to the differences in the way the models simulate  snowfall and the improved representation of topography in the CPM (see Kendon et al, 2019a, Section 3.5  for further details). In the updated Local 2.2km projections (released July 2021), there is a much improved  representation of snowfall and lying snow at the surface compared to the original Local 2.2km projections  (released September 2019). In general this leads to greater consistency between the CPM and RCM. The updated Local (2.2km) model produces more snowfall over the Scottish mountains and less in the  vicinity of the northwest coastline of Scotland compared to the RCM. There is also more lying snow over high  ground in Scotland in the CPM. These differences are likely explained by the higher resolution of the CPM  leading to a better representation of mountains, and the ability of the CPM to better represent the  movement of convective showers inland. Therefore, the Local (2.2km) projections provide the best  information available on snow in the UKCP suite of products, due to the better representation of topography  and wintertime convective showers. What do you need to be aware of? This factsheet details the biases in the data, though direct comparison with observations is difficult. Users  should be aware that both the Regional (12km) and Local (2.2km) projections underestimate uncertainties,  as they only downscale versions of the Met Office Hadley Centre model. Although the local projections can provide information on small-scale weather events in the future, they  should not be confused with an operational weather forecast, which provides information on weather that is  likely to be experienced in the next few days. Instead the local projections provide a set of plausible projections  of climate change for the UK, if we follow a high emission scenario (i.e. RCP8.5). In particular, they provide  information on the local effects of changes in the types of weather that may be experienced in the future.  The local projections sample a narrower range of potential future outcomes than the full set of global  projections. In particular, the regional climate models only downscale 12 members of the PPE-15 (and are in  turn downscaled using the CPM) and none of the CMIP5-13.

How does UKCP18 handle extreme precipitation stats?,"['chunk: •  The UKCP18 probabilistic projections consist of 3000 individual realizations of time-dependent climate  change plus a set of probability distributions, derived from the realizations and presented as probability  density functions (pdfs) and cumulative distribution functions (cdfs). •  These products are provided on a 25km national grid and for 43 aggregated regions. They have been  updated to incorporate five developments. These improve consistency between the probabilistic  projections and the climate model data on which they are based and make the projections easier to use. •  The results cited in this Summary refer mainly to projected changes for 2070-2089 relative to 1981- 2000 under RCP85 1  emissions. This scenario and period is selected to illustrate the impacts of the  developments most clearly, because it gives the strongest anthropogenic forcing and largest changes  available in the probabilistic projections data. Where differences between the new and original  projections are quoted as absolute numbers (e.g., in °C or percentage precipitation anomaly), users  should note that smaller differences will be found in earlier 21 st  century periods or in the other four  emissions scenarios for which pdfs are provided, since these correspond to lower greenhouse gas  emissions and so have weaker forcing than RCP85. What are the developments? •  Two of the developments fix software errors found during analysis of the original UKCP18 results. •  The first resolves an error in the downscaling section of the probabilistic calculations, strengthening and  tightening relationships between global and regional climate model simulations used to add spatial detail  to the projected changes. This fix applies to all the probabilistic projection variables. Correcting the  downscaling error has its largest impacts when uncertainties in projected changes are large in  comparison to the median signals of projected change. This is because the error affects the component  of projected responses that varies between the climate model simulations used to determine the  downscaling relationships, but not the component common to all the simulations.  •  The second development fixes a software error affecting daily maximum and minimum surface  temperature (Tmax and Tmin) results from one of the ensembles of global climate model simulations  used in the projections. Correcting this error tightens relationships between projected changes in Tmax,  Tmin and daily mean surface temperature (Tmean), improving physical consistency and substantially  reducing the scatter found in the original UKCP18 results. •  A third development improves the treatment of extreme changes in precipitation. This involves merging  the original version of the statistical calculations with an alternate version that uses a logarithmic  transform to avoid statistical generation of unrealistic negative precipitation amounts. Merging improves  the credibility of projected changes that are either extremely dry or extremely wet. In the new  projections it is no longer necessary to truncate the 3000 realizations to remove instances of negative  precipitation outcomes. 1  In this report we cite results from the RCP2.6 and 8.5 emissions scenarios of Moss et al.

What uncertainties do UKCP18's scenarios show between transient and stabilized warming levels?,"['chunk: Additional caveats and limitations come with:  •  Derived projections. •  Extended exploratory time-mean sea level projections.  •  Tide and surge simulations. The derived projections over UK land areas use approximate methods to produce an estimate of RCP2.6  and global warming levels of 2 and 4 ° C (compared to pre-industrial). This introduces additional  uncertainties. One of the major assumptions is that we can use the climate model time series that reach  particular warming levels through the 21 st  century (transient) to inform a future that has reached a steady  warming level (stabilized). There is some evidence that future climate outcomes at a particular global  warming level can differ depending on whether that warming level is transient or stabilized (e.g. Ceppi et al,  2018). See UKCP18 Derived Scenarios Report (Gohar et al, 2018).  The extended exploratory time-mean sea level projections have much lower confidence than the 21 st   Century Projections. Consider these projections as sensitivity studies and do not interpret them as showing  the full range of post-2100 behaviour, or the most likely behaviour. The potential for additional sea level rise  from Antarctic dynamic ice discharge is even more uncertain on these time horizons, with some studies  suggesting several additional metres of rise by 2300 under RCP8.5.  The simulations of changes in tide and surge characteristics make the simple assumption of a fixed  coastline under all levels of future sea level rise.  10.  Take care when comparing/combining variables When carrying out analyses that consider more than one variable, ensure that any outcomes are consistent  and coherent in their representation of the changes. For the probabilistic projections, there is no spatial  coherence. For the global, regional, local and derived projections ensure that you choose variables from the  same member of the set of projections. For example, summer temperature from one member is unlikely to  be consistent with precipitation from another. Choosing a model based on being amongst the largest of the probabilistic climate changes in summer  does not necessarily translate into the same model being in such an extreme position in the winter  change results.

What influences UK sea level changes and their effects on coastal flooding?,"['chunk: The pattern of sea level rise is not uniform across the UK. Sea level rise is less in the north and more in the south,  this is mainly due to the movement of land, up and down.    We can continue to expect  increases to extreme coastal water levels driven mainly by increases in mean sea level  rise, although w  e cannot rule out additional changes in storm surges.    UKCP18 includes exploratory estimates of sea level rise out to 2300, which show continued rise beyond 2100. Sea  level rise is a long  -term challenge that initial results suggest varies substantially depending on how successful we are at curbing  global greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years.    10', 'chunk: •  The risk of coastal flood events will rise with the projections of increase in time-mean sea level. However,  based on storm surge modelling work, we suggest a best estimate of no significant additional increase in  the statistics of extreme water levels associated with atmospheric storminess change. The largest trend  found in our set of surge simulations of this additional component corresponds to a change of  approximately 10 cm per century for the 1-year return level, which is considerably less than the time- mean sea level change under the same emission scenario. However, we cannot rule out larger trends in  storm surge due to this additional component. The additional component could be either positive  (augmenting the mean sea level change) or negative (partially offsetting the mean sea level change).  •  21 st  century projections of average wave height suggest changes of the order 10-20% and a general  tendency towards lower wave heights. Changes in extreme waves are also of order 10-20%, but there is  little agreement in the sign of change among the model projections. High resolution wave simulations  suggest that the changes in wave climate over the 21 st  century on exposed coasts will be dominated by  the large-scale response to climate change. However, more sheltered coastal regions are likely to remain  dominated by local weather variability.  •  Exploratory, time-mean sea level projections to 2300 suggest that UK sea levels will continue to rise  over the coming centuries under all emission scenarios considered. For London the projection ranges at  2300 are approximately 0.5 - 2.2m and 1.4 - 4.3m for the lowest and highest emission scenarios,  respectively. The values for Edinburgh and Belfast are lower. The projections extending beyond 2100  should be considered as illustrative of the potential future changes.

Winds associated with major storm events can be some of the most damaging and disruptive events   for the UK with implications for property, power networks, road and rail transport and aviation. Calm periods with little wind, particularly over prolonged periods, can affect air quality whilst winds from   a particular direction can be a critical factor in the spread of pathogens.  Both of these cases are also  examples where the combination of factors such as wind, temperature and precipitation can exacerbate  their impacts (e.g. air quality issues tend to be worse under conditions of light winds and higher  temperatures; pathogen spread can require wind, temperature and precipitation conditions to be  favourable). Wind direction, as characterised using weather types (see the UKCP18 Factsheet on Weather Types), has a  significant influence on the conditions experienced in different parts of the UK.

What caused the UKCP Local projections' daylight error and its link to the graupel error in the simulations?,"['chunk: In addition to the graupel code error, a couple of other issues have been recently found that effect  the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections. Firstly, an error has been found in the calculation of grid box  latitude and longitude coordinates provided to the radiation scheme.  In the case of variable  resolution configurations like the UKCP CPM, the calculation was performed as if all grid boxes are  evenly spaced.  Consequently, the incoming solar radiation has a largely symmetrical error with not  enough incoming radiation in the North of the domain and too much in the South. The magnitude of  the error is largest in winter where it reaches 3.5 W m -2  for the UKCP 2.2km CPM domain.  Initial  results suggest that the impact on surface variables is minimal with surface temperature differences  less than 0.05ᵒC, nevertheless we plan to additionally fix this grid coordinate error in the new 2.2km  CPM runs.  Secondly an error has been found in the code used to generate Easy Aerosol (Stevens et al 2017)  ancillaries used in both the UKCP Regional (12km) and Local (2.2km) projections. The error was in  the pre-processing code that converts diagnostics output from the 60km GCM to Easy Aerosol input  files. It resulted in daylight hours weighting, which is used to calculate shortwave aerosol radiative  effects, being set at the value for September for all months, instead of varying month-by-month.  This led to too much shortwave aerosol impact in summer and not enough in winter. 10-year test  simulations were carried out to assess the impact of this daylight-hours error. In the RCM, the  impact was found to be small and less than the spread across the 12-member ensemble (except for  precipitation where local differences could be large reflecting just noise due to natural variability).  The impact was found to be greatest over central/eastern Europe, where future increases in  temperature may b e overestimated (by up to 1ᵒC in winter and 0.5ᵒC in summer) in the UKCP  Regional projections; over the UK impacts are much smaller (with maximum local impacts of 0.2- 0.3ᵒC). On this basis the error was judged to be not significant and there was no evidence to support  a rerun of the Regional (12km) projections. Similar results were found on assessing the impact of the  daylight-hours error in the CPM. Although the impact of the error is small, we plan to additionally fix  this error in the new 2.2km CPM runs. We note that this will introduce a small inconsistency in the  aerosol forcing between the 2.2km CPM and the 12km RCM, but Easy Aerosol only provides an  approximation of the real aerosol forcing (e.g. it ignores cloud-aerosol interactions, Stevens et al  2017) and thus is associated with significant uncertainty anyway.  We are also considering additional science changes to include before starting the full set of  experiments.

What caused the UKCP Local projections' daylight error and its link to the graupel error in the simulations?,"['chunk: In addition to the graupel code error, a couple of other issues have been recently found that effect  the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections. Firstly, an error has been found in the calculation of grid box  latitude and longitude coordinates provided to the radiation scheme.  In the case of variable  resolution configurations like the UKCP CPM, the calculation was performed as if all grid boxes are  evenly spaced.  Consequently, the incoming solar radiation has a largely symmetrical error with not  enough incoming radiation in the North of the domain and too much in the South. The magnitude of  the error is largest in winter where it reaches 3.5 W m -2  for the UKCP 2.2km CPM domain.  Initial  results suggest that the impact on surface variables is minimal with surface temperature differences  less than 0.05ᵒC, nevertheless we plan to additionally fix this grid coordinate error in the new 2.2km  CPM runs.  Secondly an error has been found in the code used to generate Easy Aerosol (Stevens et al 2017)  ancillaries used in both the UKCP Regional (12km) and Local (2.2km) projections. The error was in  the pre-processing code that converts diagnostics output from the 60km GCM to Easy Aerosol input  files. It resulted in daylight hours weighting, which is used to calculate shortwave aerosol radiative  effects, being set at the value for September for all months, instead of varying month-by-month.  This led to too much shortwave aerosol impact in summer and not enough in winter. 10-year test  simulations were carried out to assess the impact of this daylight-hours error. In the RCM, the  impact was found to be small and less than the spread across the 12-member ensemble (except for  precipitation where local differences could be large reflecting just noise due to natural variability).  The impact was found to be greatest over central/eastern Europe, where future increases in  temperature may b e overestimated (by up to 1ᵒC in winter and 0.5ᵒC in summer) in the UKCP  Regional projections; over the UK impacts are much smaller (with maximum local impacts of 0.2- 0.3ᵒC). On this basis the error was judged to be not significant and there was no evidence to support  a rerun of the Regional (12km) projections. Similar results were found on assessing the impact of the  daylight-hours error in the CPM. Although the impact of the error is small, we plan to additionally fix  this error in the new 2.2km CPM runs. We note that this will introduce a small inconsistency in the  aerosol forcing between the 2.2km CPM and the 12km RCM, but Easy Aerosol only provides an  approximation of the real aerosol forcing (e.g. it ignores cloud-aerosol interactions, Stevens et al  2017) and thus is associated with significant uncertainty anyway.  We are also considering additional science changes to include before starting the full set of  experiments.

What factors and methods underpin UKCP18's Bayesian probabilities for climate projections?,"['chunk: For a given emissions scenario, the probabilistic projections provide distributions of future climate changes  consistent with internal climate variability, and uncertainties in the representation of earth system  processes. The results are Bayesian probabilities that represent the relative strength of evidence behind  alternative future changes. These are conditional upon the evidence (observations and model simulations)  used to derive them, and subjective judgements required to synthesise the evidence in the calculations.  The bullets below provide an overview of major components of the Bayesian method, followed by a  summary of the underlying climate model simulations and their main roles in the calculations. Specific  details of the implementation for projections of extremes are provided in section 2.3. A fuller outline of the  UKCP Probabilistic methodology is available in Murphy et al. (2018). A detailed description will follow in  Harris et al. (2021), building on the original implementation of Sexton et al. (2012) and Harris et al. (2013).  •  Definition of a “prior” parameter space.  This space represents uncertainties in earth system processes  in a single climate model (HadCM3). Its definition is reliant on judgements from model parameterisation  experts.  •  Perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) simulations.  These explore how historical simulation skill and  projected future responses vary across a set of locations in parameter space. •  Climate model emulation techniques.  These are trained on the PPE results, to provide estimates of past  and future climate at any point in the prior parameter space. •  Estimation of the “structural” component of model error.  This represents the effects of systematic  errors that cannot be resolved by varying parameters in HadCM3. Such errors can arise from the effects  of processes missing from the model, or from shortcomings in the basic assumptions used in its  dynamical integration scheme or physical parameterisations of sub-grid scale phenomena. We quantify  this term using results from an independent multi-model ensemble, assuming that differences between  outputs of PPE variants and other climate models can be treated as a proxy for structural simulation  errors relative to the real world. By construction, this neglects the impact of systematic errors that are  common to all climate models. Such errors represent an important but inevitable caveat, that arise from  limitations in current modelling capability or incomplete knowledge. For example, explicit representation  of atmospheric convective-scale dynamics (Kendon et al., 2019) has recen tly become possible in some  limited area simulations, such as UKCP Local. However, it is not yet feasible in ensembles of long global  simulations. In addition, the earth system models used in the probabilistic projections do not yet capture  the full complexity of atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere interactions, lacking explicit representations of ice  sheets, permafrost or the ocean methane cycle. Once included in future generations of models, there is  potential for such interactions to modify the projected changes presented here. •  Observational constraints.  These are derived from seasonal climatological spatial fields for a set of  twelve variables commonly used to evaluate climate models, plus several metrics of historical climate  change during the 20 th  century. The latter include spatial patterns of surface temperature change, and  global changes in upper ocean heat content and atmospheric CO 2  concentration.

"What changes were made to baseline periods and Antarctic ice dynamics in UKCP18 to match IPCC AR5, and what impact do these have on 2100 sea-level projections?","['chunk: Time-mean Sea-level Projections  Update: Technical Note 1. Summary  In August 2022, an issue was discovered with the UKCP18 processing code, which meant that the  adjustment needed to convert from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth  Assessment Report (AR5) baseline of 1986-2005 to the baseline period of 1981-2000 used in UKCP18  was not fully implemented for the site-specific time-mean sea-level projections. This issue has now been  resolved and sea-level projection datasets updated accordingly. The update results in about a 1 cm (or   0.01 m) increase for all UKCP18 site-specific sea-level projections over all timescales (e.g., projected   sea-level rise at 2030 + 1 cm, projected sea-level rise at 2100 + 1 cm). While this does affect headline  projection ranges at 2100 by + 0.01 m, the change is small and unlikely to be decision relevant. UKCP   users are encouraged to adopt the updated projections where this is practical. The updated data will be   the default version made available via CEDA and the UKCP User Interface from Ma rch 2023. 2. Description of the issue  The UKCP18 time-mean sea-level projection methods are rooted in CMIP5 climate model simulations that  are expressed relative to a baseline period of 1986-2005 (M. Palmer et al., 2018; M. D. Palmer et al., 2020).  It was therefore necessary to apply a small adjustment to these sea-level projections to express them  relative to the 1981-2000 baseline as described in section A1.1.1 of the UKCP18 Marine Report:    “Since the IPCC AR5 GMSL projections were formulated relative to a baseline period of 1986-2005 it is      necessary to carry out a small adjustment to the component time series to provide projections across       UKCP18 for a common baseline period of 1981-2000. This is achieved on the basis of the average       difference between the two baseline periods computed using four tide-gauge reconstructions of GMSL      (Church & White, 2011; Hay et al., 2015; Jevrejeva et al., 2014; Ray & Douglas, 2011). The result is an       offset of +0.011m for the total sea level, which is then applied across components according to the       proportion of sea level change that each accounts for in the first decade of the projections (assuming that     these are representative of the earlier period). These proportions are: 40.5% for Thermal Expansion; 9.5%      for Antarctica; 12.5% for Greenland; 27% for Glaciers and 10.5% for Land Water.”  While this adjustment was successfully applied for the UKCP18 global mean sea level (GMSL) projections,   a flaw in the processing code meant that this adjustment was not carried across to the site-specific UK  sea-level projections.

Projections of time-mean sea level are presented as yearly  values over the 21 st  century. The potential for changes in storm surges and wave climate over the 21 st   century are discussed in sections 3.2 and 3.3, respectively.  The UKCP18 time-mean sea level projections are rooted in the materials and methods described in the  IPCC AR5 (Church et al, 2013) (see section A1.1 for a full description). Following the approach of the IPCC  AR5, we present a range of future sea level rise for any given scenario on the basis of the 5 th  and 95 th   percentiles of the underlying process-based model projections. IPCC AR5 referred to this as the “likely  range” based on their expert judgement that there was a  ⅔  chance of sea level rise falling within this model  range, for a given scenario. The UKCP18 interpretation of the projection ranges presented in this report is  that there may be a greater than 10% chance that the real-world response lies outside these ranges and  that this likelihood cannot be accurately quantified.  In the following sections, we present projections of global mean sea level and show how the UKCP18 results  differ from the projections presented in the IPCC AR5 (section 3.1.1). We also discuss the potential for  accelerated sea level rise from Antarctic land-based ice loss, which is a topic that has received a lot of  attention since the publication of the IPCC AR5 (section 3.1.2). Regional coastal projections for the UK,  which are derived from our GMSL projections, are presented in section 3.1.3.  3�1�1 Global mean sea level (GMSL) projections  The UKCP18 global mean sea level (GMSL) projections differ from the IPCC AR5 projections for two  reasons: (i) we use a baseline period of 1981-2000 rather than 1986-2005; (ii) we include updated  estimates of the contribution from Antarctic ice dynamics, following Levermann et al, (2014; see section  A1.1). The change of baseline period results in a small +0.01m increase in projected values of GMSL. The  change in Antarctic ice dynamics brings about more substantive changes to the GMSL projections,  systematically increasing the projections and in particular, raising the value of the 95 th  percentile (i.e. the  upper bound of the likely range). The 2100 values for the IPCC AR5 and UKCP18 are summarised in Table  3.1.1. A comparison of the UKCP18 projection for RCP4.5 and the available satellite altimeter observations  shows good agreement in the contemporary rates of GMSL change (figure 3.1.2).

"""What improvements does GC3.05 have for climate modeling?""","['chunk: •  The global climate model projections also rely on global climate models with their inherent abilities and  limitations. However, the set includes the latest Met Office climate model (GC3.05) which has a greater  spatial detail than many other global models and many improvements to the treatment of atmospheric  physics compared to earlier models. This model performs better at replicating many observed aspects of  climate than earlier Met Office models, such as that used in producing the probabilistic projections, but  does focus more on the higher end of the range of future warming. The set of GC3.05 projections is  augmented with additional projections from IPCC CMIP5 models so that a wider range of future global  warming is simulated.  •  The sets of global and UK future climates has limited sizes and whilst it does cover a range of diverse  futures, it can not simulate every possible future climate. This is especially true of the regional climate  model set of projections which is not driven by any CMIP5 model simulations.  •  Downscaling – the process of generating model data at higher spatial and/or temporal resolution – adds  detail but also introduces another level of uncertainty. The additional information content is still valuable  for specific applications, but finer model spatial resolution does not necessarily provide greater  confidence, unless it has been shown to give a better representation of the underlying physical processes.  For instance, the 12 km model better resolves mountains and coastlines and land surface heterogeneities;  whilst the forthcoming 2.2 km model additionally better represents atmospheric convection offering  projections of changes on local and hourly scales in which we have greater confidence.  •  The derived scenario data uses approximate methods to produce an emulation of global climate model  projections for other scenarios or fixed global warming levels based on the projections for RCP8.5. This  introduces additional uncertainties and part of the method relies on an assumption of linearity in the  model which seems reasonable for CMIP5 models based on pattern-scaling studies but has not yet been  fully demonstrated for the Met Office global climate model output.  •  Global climate models will typically provide greater confidence for long-term climate averages than  extreme events or time series of daily or sub-daily values. For the climate simulations of sea levels, storm surges and waves users should note: •  The UKCP18 21 st  century time-mean sea level projections are based upon the 5 th  to 95 th  percentiles of  the underlying model distributions. However, there may be a greater than 10% chance that the real- world response lies outside the 5 th  to 95 th  percentile range and this likelihood cannot be accurately  quantified. For instance, we cannot rule out substantial additional sea level rise associated primarily with  dynamic ice discharge from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. We recommend that decision makers make  use of multiple strands of evidence, including H++ scenarios, where available, when assessing  vulnerabilities to future extreme water levels.   •   The 21 st  century projections presented in this report are predicated on the CMIP5 climate models and  the RCP climate change scenarios.

"What mechanisms in SCM adjust for variances in climate predictions, including GMST, CO2, and OHC, under different inputs?","['chunk: •  Estimates of discrepancy are required for global, time-dependent outputs of the SCM. In addition to  GMST, these include atmospheric CO 2  concentration and upper ocean heat content (OHC,  representing the top 700 metres). Historical changes in these variables are used as observational  constraints in (c) below. For each CMIP5-ESM member, the best PPE analogues in x a , identified in  Stage 1d, are augmented by finding best analogues in x scm . The SCM is then run using these parameter  settings (Fig. 2.4a, top left). Differences between the GMST, CO 2  and OHC outputs of each CMIP5- ESM member and their best analogues (Fig 2.4a, top right) are then used to quantify means and  variances of the relevant discrepancy distributions. The mean discrepancy for GMST reaches ~-0.3ºC  beyond 2050 (dark blue curve in Fig. 2.4a, top right), partly because the HadCM3-based analogues  tend to overestimate slightly the carbon cycle feedbacks in CMIP5-ESM members. Following  production, the annual  discrepancy estimates are low-pass filtered 5 . This is done to retain structural  uncertainty signals in long-term climate change, and exclude residual effects of internal variability  arising from the limited size of the CMIP5-ESM ensemble. •  The timescaling procedure also requires specification of time-dependent bias and residual variance  terms. These are calibrated by comparing ESPPE results against timescaling estimates produced from  corresponding locations in x es  (e.g. red and yellow curves in Fig 2.4a, top left). The bias term (e.g. red  curve in Fig. 2.4a, top right) represents the average error obtained in estimating transient responses  from the time-invariant climate change metrics of Stage 1. In the case of GMST, contributions might  arise, for example, from neglect in the SCM of potential time-dependence in the strength of global  climate feedbacks (e.g. Gregory and Andrews, 2016), or variations in the efficacy of different forcing  agents in driving surface temperature responses (Shindell, 2014). Potential dependencies of such  errors on location in x es  are not accounted for (since insufficient ESPPE simulations were available to  quantify these), but may contribute to the residual variance term. In the  case of GMST, for example,  the residual variance is derived from the orange curves in Fig. 2.4a (top right). In addition, an important  contribution to the residual arises from uncertainty due to climate variability on 1-20 year time  scales. The bias and residual variance terms are low-pass filtered to remove noise arising from the  limited number of ESPPE simulations available for calibration, with the exception that the bias is left  unfiltered during years affected by major volcanic eruptions (see Appendix A).     •  Realisations 6  of GMST (Fig 2.4a, bottom left), CO 2  and OHC are produced by running the SCM using input  parameters sampled from x es . Like the ESPPE, the SCM is driven by historical solar and volcanic forcing,  plus emissions of CO 2  and concentrations of other major greenhouse gases, switching from historical to  scenario values after 2005. Anthropogenic changes in global-mean aerosol forcing are also included in  the SCM. Uncertainties in these are accounted for by sampling from a skew normal distribution  consistent with an estimate of the median and range for total aerosol forcing in 2011 (Myhre et al., 2013).  Historical and future sulphur dioxide emissions are used to scale the forcing for other periods. •  Each SCM realisation is modified, by adding the timescaling bias term and sampling the discrepancy  and timescaling residual distributions. The timescaling residual adds a noise component to the SCM  outputs that accounts for climate variability, and is generated using a sampling method (AUTOVAR)  that preserves temporal autocorrelations found during calibration to ESPPE simulations (Appendix A).  5   In this report, low-pass filtering of time series is applied, to distinguish between long-term climate changes and variability on shorter time scales.  This is done using a Butterworth filter, with a cut-off period of 20 years unless stated.   6   The Strand 1 outputs consist of a large sample of projected changes produced using statistical methods. Individual members of this sample are  referred to as “realisations” in this report. The individual simulations of climate change that constitute Strands 2 and 3, provided by global or  regional climate models, are referred to as “projections”.

"""What underlies UKCP18's climate projections?""","['chunk: 2.  Climate projections are dependent on future greenhouse   gases assumptions The change in climate projected by models in UKCP18 is strongly dependent on future global greenhouse  gas emissions. UKCP18 uses scenarios for future greenhouse gases called the representative concentration  pathways (RCPs) which cover a more up-to-date (compared to UKCP09) range of assumptions around  future population, economic development and to explicitly include the possibility of mitigation of  greenhouse gas emissions towards international targets. Each pathway drives a different range of simulated  global mean temperature increases over the 21 st  century. The RCP pathways lead to a broad range of  climate outcomes but are neither forecasts nor policy recommendations.  The four RCPs considered in UKCP18 attempt to capture a range of potential alternative futures, spanning a  range of outcomes, further guidance is available on the  UKCP18 website . The real world may follow a  different pathway altogether. The scientific community cannot reliably place probabilities on which scenario  of greenhouse gas emissions is most likely. See Box 1 in UKCP18 Science Overview, (Lowe et al, 2018) for further guidance. 3.  Estimated ranges for future climate are conditional As with all climate modelling, the estimated ranges for future climate are conditioned on a set of modelling,  statistical, and dataset choice assumptions with expert judgement playing a role in the various  methodological and data choices. As the science evolves some of these preferred choices will also change,  which will lead to new estimates of uncertainty. At this time, the UKCP18 project team believe the UKCP18  ranges best capture our understanding of potential future outcomes.  The probabilistic projections adopt a particular set of methods including an approach to emulating climate  models, treatment of structural uncertainty and use of a particular simple energy balance climate model.  The approach also downscales results to the 25km scale using a statistical approach based on a global  model-regional model pairing from a single model structure. Each stage of the method has many  assumptions and relies on expert judgement. See section 2.2 of UKCP18 Land Projections: Science Report,  (Murphy et al, 2018). For RCP8.5, it is clear that the PPE-15 models tend to sample the warmer end of the future response range  projected by the probabilistic approach and CMIP5-13 models sample the mid-range and colder end – with  some limited overlap in the middle. This is consistent with recent research into a HADGEM3 model version  (GC3.1), to which the UKCP18 GC3.05 versions of the model are closely related, having an equilibrium  climate sensitivity (ECS) 1  above the likely end of the current IPCC range, and higher than the CMIP5 set of  models. In the IPCC’s 5th Assessment, ECS was judged to have a “likely” range of 1.5-4.5°C (Collins et al,  2013), and that there is a small probability (of up to 10%) that ECS exceeds 6°C. The 2°C and 4°C worlds from the Derived Projections offer an alternative approach that does not depend  on the equilibrium climate sensitivity. However, they come with their own limitations (see Section 9). 1   ECS is an important characteristic of climate models is the amount of warming that can be expected in response to the concentration of carbon  dioxide in the atmosphere reaching double the level observed in pre-industrial times. However, potential users should note that the projected  response over the UK has a wider spread in both GC3.05 and CMIP5 projection sets and the degree of overlap of the sets is greater.

It also provides an extra product of derived  data derived from the global projections for a future scenario with lower emissions of greenhouse gases and  for 2°C and 4°C of global warming. A guidance note is provided to users on selecting the approach or  approaches that are most suited to them (Fung et al, 2018). We summarise some of the major  considerations in Table 2.5, alongside a reminder of the characteristics of the data products.  The probabilistic projections, global projections and regional projections that comprise the UKCP18 land  projections are all derived from climate models, which approximate the real climate system. Hence, there  can be systematic differences between climate model results and observations (i.e. biases). In addition,  climate scientists do not yet understand some potential influences on future climate well enough to include  them in current models. Despite these limitations the combined evidence of UKCP18 covers a broad range  of potential future climate pathways. However, it remains possible that real world future changes could lie  outside the envelope of these estimates. Future generations of climate models will be developed that  reflect improved scientific capabilities and understanding, potentially leading to a requirement to update  the UKCP18 projections with new, and potentially different, advice. The probabilistic projections are designed to provide a primary tool for assessments of the widest range of  uncertainties in UKCP18, and generally show broader ranges of future climate than the global and regional  climate model projections. They can be an important tool for a variety of different types of risk assessment,  including when attempting to be robust against all simulated scenarios, and when used alongside other  information such as the global and regional projections of climate and of course, information on  vulnerabilities, adaptation options and risk tolerance. They may be especially useful for the avoidance of  overconfident decision-making. The probabilistic projections are derived from a statistical framework that  supports the formal application of observational constraints, and estimation of the relative likelihood of  specific outcomes. We emphasise again, that these are conditional on the knowledge, data, methods and  expert choices used to construct them. If a d ecision is sensitive to relative likelihood or focused heavily on  specific probability levels, then we recommend users test the sensitivity of their findings to the UKCP18  results.

How do UKCP18 regional projections refine AR5 GMSL estimates with updated Antarctic ice dynamics and uncertainty treatments?,"['chunk: A1�1 21 st  century regional time-mean sea level projections Section summary: In this section we present the materials and methods used to produce the regional  time-mean sea level projections for UKCP18� The starting point is the projections of global mean sea  level (GMSL) presented in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)� These global changes are  regionalised for the UK by considering the spatial patterns associated with each of the components of  global sea level and also assessing the contribution to local sea level change associated with ongoing  glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA, sometimes referred to as “post-glacial rebound)� Our method goes  beyond the global and regional projections presented in AR5 by: (i) using a more recent scenario- dependent estimate of the contribution from Antarctic ice dynamics; (ii) using a regression-based  approach to projections of oceanographic regional sea level change; (iii) including multiple estimates of  the regional “mass fingerprints” and GIA changes; (iv) incorporating an improved statistical t reatment of  the regional sea level uncertainties that is directly traceable to the AR5 GMSL projections�  A1�1�1 Global mean sea level (GMSL) projections  The regional time-mean sea level projections presented in UKCP18 are rooted in the process-based global  mean sea level (GMSL) projections described in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report of Working Group 1  (AR5; Church et al, 2013). The only difference in the GMSL projections used in UKCP18 is that we update  the estimate of the sea level contribution from Antarctic ice dynamics following the work of Levermann et  al, (2014). In this section we present a brief synopsis of the AR5 methods and provide a comparison with  the UKCP18 GMSL projections for the 21 st  century. We refer the reader to Church et al, (2013) and the  associated supplementary materials (available at  http://www.climatechange2013.org/report/full-report/ )  for a more complete discussion.  The GMSL projections presented in AR5 (Church et al, 2013) include estimates of the contribution from: (i)  ocean thermal expansion; (ii) mass changes in the Greenland Ice Sheet; (iii) mass changes in the Antarctic  Ice Sheet; (iv) mass changes in other ice caps and glaciers; (v) changes in sea level related to projections of  groundwater extraction and reservoir impoundment. The ice sheet terms are further broken down into a  contribution from surface mass balance and a contribution from ice dynamics, resulting in a total of seven  individual components of GMSL change. There were three major advances in the sea level science reported  in AR5 compared to the previous IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4, Bindoff et al, 2007). The first was  the demonstration of closure of the GMSL budget, i.e. the summation of observation-based estimates of  terms (i) - (v) was consistent with an independent estimate of GMSL change based on a tide-gauge  reconstruction for the period 1971-2008 (Church et  al, 2011). The second was the demonstration of better  agreement between process-based model estimates of GMSL change and observations. The third was the  inclusion of scenario-independent estimates of the contribution from ice dynamics (i.e. changes in the flow  of ice into the ocean) for both Greenland and Antarctica, which led to systematically larger GMSL  projections than were reported in IPCC AR4, as discussed by Palmer et al, (2016). The AR5 processed-based GMSL projections are based upon the output of 21 CMIP5 (Taylor et al, 2012)  global climate models under the Representative Concentration Pathway climate change scenarios (RCPs;  Meinshausen et al, 2011).

How does fixing the graupel code error affect UK precipitation extremes' return levels estimation?,"['chunk: As above, the results here are based on using 19 years of data from a single ensemble member, and  so the estimation of return levels is subject to uncertainty. Therefore, we focus on relatively modest  extremes, specifically the 2-year and 5-year return levels of hourly and daily precipitation. In order  to assess whether the impact of the graupel code error is significant, we compare differences on  fixing the graupel with the spread across the original 12-member CPM ensemble. The key results are  as follows:  Hourly precipitation extremes:  •   The graupel code error has a significant impact on present-day return levels of hourly  precipitation extremes, even in summer, and a smaller but significant impact on future changes.  •   Present-day 2-year and 5-year return levels are reduced by about 20% on average across the UK  on fixing the graupel code error. This is the case on using data from all seasons and on using data  just from summer (which for hourly extremes largely dominates the all-year result, Figs 17 & 18).  The magnitude of the differences on fixing the graupel code error are larger than the original  UKCP CPM ensemble spread across almost all of the UK (for the 5-year return level the UK- average difference on fixing the graupel is 3.3 mm/h compared to an ensemble standard  deviation of 1.6 mm/h, Fig 17).  •   Future increases in 2-year and 5-year return levels are slightly greater (29% increase becomes  36% increase for 5-year return level) on fixing the error (Fig 19). In the case of the 5-year return  level, these differences are of a similar magnitude to the original UKCP ensemble spread in  future changes (Fig 19). Similar results are seen for summer (Fig 20): in this case the ensemble  spread is larger, but the impact of fixing the error can still exceed the ensemble standard  deviation locally.  •   Preliminary results looking at the 10-year return level of hourly precipitation extremes (not  shown) suggest that the impact of the graupel code error on the 10-year return level is very  similar to that for the 5-year return level with about a 20-25% reduction in the present-day  value, an increase in the future change (from 28% to 36%), and the difference in uplifts of a  similar magnitude to the ensemble standard deviation. With only 19-years of data from a single  ensemble member, it is not possible to investigate the impact of the graupel code error on  longer return period events.  •   The above results indicate that there is a significant impact of the graupel code error on present- day return levels of hourly precipitation extremes and, although to a lesser extent, their future  changes. If all ensemble members are impacted by the graupel code error in a similar way to this  single-member test there may be a systematic shift in the ensemble projected change of about  5-10% which could be important for some applications.  Daily precipitation extremes:  •   The impact of the graupel code error is less for daily precipitation extremes than hourly  precipitation extremes. For daily extremes, the graupel code error has a small, but locally  significant, impact on present-day return levels, but (in contrast to hourly extremes) does not  have a significant impact on future changes.  •   Present-day 2-year and 5-year return levels of daily precipitation extremes are reduced by about  5% on average across the UK on fixing the graupel code error (Fig 21). These differences are  larger than the original UKCP CPM ensemble spread over western areas, and so are significant  locally.']","Fixing the graupel code error significantly impacts the return levels of UK precipitation extremes. For hourly precipitation extremes, it reduces present-day 2-year and 5-year return levels by about 20% on average across the UK and increases future return levels slightly more than the original estimates. For daily precipitation extremes, it reduces present-day 2-year and 5-year return levels by about 5% on average across the UK, but does not significantly impact future changes.",multi_context,True,gpt-4-turbo,sections,,,,,
"""How does Harris et al.'s SCM integrate ECS_L & ECS_O for temp projections across environments?""","['chunk: •  These are made using the two-box simple climate model (SCM) of Harris et al (2013), which uses  energy balance principles to predict ocean and land surface temperature in response to prescribed  natural and anthropogenic forcing.

"""How does the Atlantic Jet Stream affect Euro climate patterns?""","['chunk: The Atlantic Jet Stream (or the ‘eddy-driven jet’) is a core of strong winds around 5 to 7 miles above the  Earth’s surface, blowing from west to east. Shifting jet stream patterns can have a big impact on UK weather,  particularly by determining the position of the North Atlantic Storm track in winter. For example, read about  the influence of the jet stream on the unusually wet October 2019 ( https://blog.metoffice.gov. uk/2019/11/04/the-jet-stream-casts-its-shadow-over-the-uk-duringoctober/ ). The winter jet stream over the North Atlantic has 3 ‘preferred’ positions – at around 35-38°N, 45-47°N and  58-60°N  Woollings et al. (2010) . The position determines the path that weather systems and storms take  across the Atlantic. This tri-modal pattern, and the long-term average frequency at which the jet takes each  of the three positions, is reasonably well captured by the UKCP Global models 1  (Figure 1). Figure 2 illustrates the differences in rainfall patterns associated with a strong jet in each of the three  positions - when a strong jet is in the ‘North’ position (50-60°N) it brings wetter-than-average conditions to  the northern Europe (Scotland and Scandinavia); conversely in the ‘South’ position (30-40°N) it is Southern  Europe (Spain and Mediterranean Europe) that receive greater than average rainfall. The UK experiences  greater-than-average rainfall when a strong jet is in its ‘Mid’ position (40-50°N). It’s important to note that there is large year-to-year natural variability in the number of days when the jet is  in each of these three positions, which is one reason why some years are wetter and/or stormier than others  in the UK.

The frequency distribution is  a smoothed representation of the number of days that the jet sits within a given latitude interval during the period 1981-2000. 1  We’ve compared the climate model results with a historical quasi-observed dataset, ERA-Interim. These quasi-observed datasets are produced by  combining meteorological observations and a climate model to give a more complete picture of the climate during an observed period.

"""How was drought risk assessed in the Yorkshire Water study using a simple hydrological index and UKCP18 data?""","['chunk: Both case studies developed a set of actions for organisations to take,  some to do soon after UKCP18 release and others that would require  longer-term co-ordination and investment. More specifically, each  case study looked in detail (examples below) at how UKCP18 could be  used to reproduce existing assessments of flood and drought, enabling  a quick comparison with previous results.  Case Study 1:  JBA developed the methodology behind the EA’s  Flood Map for Surface Water (FMfSW); a key reference for Local  Authorities when conducting surface flooding preparedness and  response planning. Underlying the FMfSW analysis is the specification  of total rainfall for different durations and probabilities – called ‘Depth  Duration Curves’ (spanning 1, 3 and 6-hour events for 3.3%, 1% and  0.1% annual probability). This first case study outlined how a user  could recreate these curves for present-day and future periods using  UKCP18 projections of hourly rainfall from the high-resolution (2.2 km)  climate model. Case Study 2:  In 2012, Yorkshire Water commissioned a study into  multi-year drought by applying a relatively simple hydrological drought  index (DSI6) to observed precipitation records from a selection of rain  gauge stations across Yorkshire. A weather generator was used to  supplement the observational record by providing an ensemble of 200  time series for the same baseline period at each location.

"""What online tools can analyze and customize UKCP18 data?""","['chunk: •  The risk of coastal flood events will rise with the projections of increase in time-mean sea level. However,  based on storm surge modelling work, we suggest a best estimate of no significant additional increase in  the statistics of extreme water levels associated with atmospheric storminess change. The largest trend  found in our set of surge simulations of this additional component corresponds to a change of  approximately 10 cm per century for the 1-year return level, which is considerably less than the time- mean sea level change under the same emission scenario. However, we cannot rule out larger trends in  storm surge due to this additional component. The additional component could be either positive  (augmenting the mean sea level change) or negative (partially offsetting the mean sea level change).  •  21 st  century projections of average wave height suggest changes of the order 10-20% and a general  tendency towards lower wave heights. Changes in extreme waves are also of order 10-20%, but there is  little agreement in the sign of change among the model projections. High resolution wave simulations  suggest that the changes in wave climate over the 21 st  century on exposed coasts will be dominated by  the large-scale response to climate change. However, more sheltered coastal regions are likely to remain  dominated by local weather variability.  •  Exploratory, time-mean sea level projections to 2300 suggest that UK sea levels will continue to rise  over the coming centuries under all emission scenarios considered. For London the projection ranges at  2300 are approximately 0.5 - 2.2m and 1.4 - 4.3m for the lowest and highest emission scenarios,  respectively. The values for Edinburgh and Belfast are lower.

The  new projections consist of three Strands, described in detail in sections 2-4. The Strands are built to serve  types of user requirement that are related, but also somewhat distinct, and each Strand uses different  climate modelling inputs. For some applications it may be appropriate to consider combining information  from two or more Strands to obtain the most comprehensive advice (section 5.2). The Strands include some  inter-dependencies in their designs, to help with this. Below, we discuss how developments since UKCP09  have informed the content of UKCP18, and introduce the three Strands.

A summary is  provided in section 6.   1.1. Recap of UKCP09 The centrepiece of the UKCP09 land component was a set of probabilistic projections (Murphy et al., 2009).  These expressed a broad range of plausible outcomes for UK climate during the 21 st  century, for a set of key  climate variables. They were provided for three future emissions pathways (the B1, A1B and A1FI scenarios  of Nakicenovic and Swart (2000), labelled “low”, “medium” and “high”), for a national 25km grid and two  sets of aggregated regions. The probabilistic projections were presented as 30-year monthly, seasonal and  annual average changes, expressed relative to a 1961-1990 baseline. They represented known  uncertainties (due to internal climate variability and the modelling of key Earth system processes),  consistent with available climate model simulations and the knowledge contained within them. The  projections were constructed from several ensembles of variants of a single climate model (HadCM3),  representing modelling uncertainties by perturbing model parameters  within expert-specified ranges. These  perturbed parameter ensembles (PPEs) were combined with results from the Coupled Model  Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) ensemble of international global climate models (GCMs), and a  set of observational metrics of historical model performance (Sexton et al., 2012; Harris et al., 2013). A  weather generator (Jones et al., 2010) was also provided. This was driven by change factors sampled from  the projections in order to assess localised impacts and risks in many applications. The UKCP09 projections  were the first UK scenarios to include intrinsic, quantitative estimates of uncertainty. They formed a major  component of the evidence bases for the first and second national climate change risk assessments  (CCRA), published in 2012 ( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-climate-change-risk- assessment-government-report ) and 2017 (CCRA2, see  https://www.theccc.org.uk/tackling-climate- change/preparing-for-climate-change/uk-climate-change-risk-assessment-2017/ ).

"""How does ESPPE improve uncertainty in climate projections vs. UKCP09?""","['chunk: •  A 57-member PPE of variants of the earth system configuration of HadCM3 (Lambert et al., 2013;  Murphy et al., 2014), produced subsequently to UKCP09, is used to represent the effects of parametric  uncertainties due to ocean, aerosol and carbon cycle processes. Use of this ensemble (hereafter ESPPE)  simplifies the method by allowing the number of PPE inputs to be reduced from seven to three. This is  mainly because ocean, aerosol and carbon cycle uncertainties can now be quantified from one  ensemble, whereas separate ensembles were used in UKCP09 (Murphy et al., 2009; Harris et al., 2013).  It also allows the effects of uncertainties in ocean and carbon cycle processes on spatial patterns of  climate change to be considered, alongside influences of land surface and atmospheric processes. In  UKCP09, ocean and carbon cycle uncertainties were only accounted for in projections of GMST.  •  Improved observational constraints are used to weight projections from different points in parameter  space, by adding metrics of historical change in upper ocean heat content and CO 2  concentration (the  latter to constrain carbon cycle feedbacks, following Booth et al., 2017). The use of historical surface  temperature changes is also updated to consider changes up to 2017 rather than 2000, thus including  the recent “warming hiatus” period (e.g. Trenberth, 2015). •  The representation of historical changes in external forcing has been improved, by using a probability  distribution for anthropogenic aerosol forcing provided by AR5 (Myhre et al., 2013), and accounting for  uncertainties in fossil fuel and land-use carbon emissions (Booth et al.,2017, updated). •  The methodology has been extended to present the probabilistic projections for individual years rather  than for the 30-year averages of UKCP09, based on the method of Sexton and Harris (2015, updated).  This allows effects of climate variability on annual to decadal time scales to be accounted for, facilitating  analysis of the changing risks of seasonal extremes and allowing observed events to be placed in the  context of the projections. Also, this annual presentation of data allows users flexibility to choose their  own baseline period (see Fig. 2.10 and related discussion), if they wish to depart from one of the options  provided on the UKCP18 website. The website options consist of the standard UKCP18 period of 1981- 2000, plus 1961-1990 and 1981-2010. •  This extension allows the probabilistic projections to contribute to user requirements for more  information on variability and extremes (driver 4 of section 1.2), providing context for the new modelling  information in Strands 2 and 3.

"""How do UKCP18 models aid in understanding temp. projections under RCP8.5?""","['chunk: The probabilistic projections discussed in the previous section provide context for how the projected future  climate might change, including providing information on the range of changes for different future  greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Many users have expressed a desire for also having a set of global and  regional climate model projections that represent how variability and long-term changes in climate might  evolve over the UK (and beyond) over the 21 st  century. Our design philosophy in UKCP18 has been to use  the most recent climate models to provide this evidence. This approach is consistent with a growing  interest by users in constructing internally consistent, physically based storylines that help us understand  the robustness of those particular futures that would be most relevant to a particular user. There is no  single climate projection that can provide this because different users have different interests and weather  vulnerabilities. Therefore, the UKCP18 set o f global model projections provides 28 plausible but diverse  projections from which to choose. The set comprises projections with the GC3.05 model and other CMIP5  models. Many of the global simulations from the GC3.05 model have been downscaled to a 12km scale and  will be further downscaled to 2.2km in future. The global and regional model projections are provided for  the RCP8.5 scenario.  The global model projections are shown as a time-series and compared to the spread from the probabilistic  projections in Figure 2.13 for global mean temperature change. It is clear that the GC3.05 models tend to  sample the warmer end of the future response range projected by the probabilistic approach and CMIP5  models sample the mid-range and colder end – with some limited overlap in the middle. This is consistent  with recent research into a HADGEM3 model version (GC3.1), to which the UKCP18 GC3.05 versions of the  model are closely related, having an equilibrium climate sensitivity above the likely end of the current IPCC  range, and higher than the CMIP5 set of models. However, potential users should note that the projected  response over the UK has a wider spread in both GC3.05 and CMIP5 projection sets and the degree of  overlap of the sets is greater. There is also a greater overlap for some metrics, such as precipitation.

This was due to issues around the verification of lightning in the CPM compared to  Arrival Time Difference Network (ATDnet) observations. Therefore, only a subjective evaluation of  lightning output from the CPM was possible, as discussed in the UKCP CPM science report (Kendon  et al., 2019). Initial results suggested that the UKCP CPM overestimates lightning in winter but  performs better in summer in terms of representing the UK-average occurrence rate, but with  potential deficiencies in the spatial distribution of lightning. It is likely that these deficiencies were at  least in part due to the graupel code error in the original UKCP CPM.  Overall, we find that lightning occurrence is reduced in the run with the graupel code error fixed  (CPM_fix), consistent with a reduction in excessive graupel. Here we present results from a case  study looking at graupel, lightning and precipitation on the 6 th  July 1983 (Fig 25). The graupel  amounts are considerably reduced in CPM_fix, and some unrealistic features present in CPM_UKCP,  such as an unusual linear feature near the western boundary of the simulation domain and  rectangular-shaped features in Ireland (which are clear indications of the graupel code error), are  not apparent in CPM_fix. Consistent with these graupel differences, lightning occurrence is also  reduced in CPM_fix, along with the removal of similar unrealistic features. It is notable that despite  significant differences in graupel amounts and lightning, away from the simulation domain  boundary, precipitation rates are very similar between the original and fixed-code runs.\nheading: Fig 24.

"What does the PPCE provide for assessing climate extremes that other UKCP products don't, especially regarding modeling uncertainties and return level percentiles?","['chunk: •  Country, administrative region and river basin region averages. This is because over a large region,  average 100-year return levels are very variable and therefore not meaningful. We have chosen to provide the data as cumulative distribution functions (cdfs) and probability distribution  functions (pdfs), but not as a set of individual samples drawn from these distributions. This is because it  would not be appropriate to interpret samples of return level in the same way as the UKCP Probabilistic  Projections. The return levels data is an expression of future climatological properties, rather than outcomes  that will necessarily occur in the year in question (see  Murphy et al, 2020 ). You can view and download the datasets from the  UKCP User Interface . If you wish to download the whole  dataset and are familiar with handling netCDF data, you can download the datasets from the  CEDA Archive .  Further information is available in  UKCP Guidance on data availability, access and formats . 3. What can I do with them that I couldn’t do before? The PPCE allows you to assess changes in temperature and precipitation extremes across five emissions  scenarios using an approach that gives a broad assessment of known modelling uncertainties. This is not  available in any other UKCP product. The data are expressed as a range of percentiles for values of a return level (e.g. the 20-year return level for  daily maximum temperature). These percentiles represent the uncertainty range for the intensity of an  event expected once within the given return period (e.g. 1 in 20 year). In other words, the probability of a  variable exceeding the projected return level in a given year is                   . 1 return period For the nuclear industry, the guidance on the use of this information is clear where the period and  percentiles are prescribed and that an adequately conservative emissions scenario is selected (ONR et al,  2019). Where they’re not prescribed, let’s take an engineering example: you wish to design a drainage system to  cope with a 1 in 20 year return period event and it has a design life of 50 years. The return period is usually  recommended in engineering design codes. It could also be informed through a vulnerability analysis of your  site which would determine the level of drainage that you wish to invest in. To check whether your drainage  system is resilient to future climate change, the Probabilistic Projections of Climate Extremes (PPCE)  provides return levels for the 1 in 20 year return period for 2070 for a number of emissions scenarios. You  should then perform a sensitivity study and see how your risk profile changes with different emission  scenarios and at different percentiles to understand what adaptation measures are required. For example,  you could design to the 90 th  percentile of the 20 year return level in 2070 under the RCP 6.0 and see how  likely the design threshold bein g exceeded would be under RCP 8.5 (i.e. take the 90 th  value within RCP 6.0  and see which percentile this corresponds to for RCP 8.5). The PP2018 provided mean statistics for a number of climate variables (e.g. temperature, precipitation,  surface pressure). The PPCE are produced using a technique (extreme value theory) based on Brown et al.  (2014) where a dependence is assumed between probability distributions parameters and global mean  surface temperatures.  You could potentially derive the metrics available in the PPCE from UKCP Global (60km), UKCP Regional  (12km) and UKCP Local (2.2km) using the same method. However, the representations of uncertainties in  comparison to the PPCE are more limited in these products and sample a narrower range of uncertainty.

What benefits do probabilistic projections provide in evaluating climate uncertainties?,"['chunk: The land projections provide a range of tools including: new probabilistic projections for four alternative  future pathways of greenhouse gas emissions; global climate model projections for the RCP8.5 simulation;  and regional climate model projections for the same scenario. It also provides an extra product of derived  data derived from the global projections for a future scenario with lower emissions of greenhouse gases and  for 2°C and 4°C of global warming. A guidance note is provided to users on selecting the approach or  approaches that are most suited to them (Fung et al, 2018). We summarise some of the major  considerations in Table 2.5, alongside a reminder of the characteristics of the data products.  The probabilistic projections, global projections and regional projections that comprise the UKCP18 land  projections are all derived from climate models, which approximate the real climate system. Hence, there  can be systematic differences between climate model results and observations (i.e. biases). In addition,  climate scientists do not yet understand some potential influences on future climate well enough to include  them in current models. Despite these limitations the combined evidence of UKCP18 covers a broad range  of potential future climate pathways. However, it remains possible that real world future changes could lie  outside the envelope of these estimates. Future generations of climate models will be developed that  reflect improved scientific capabilities and understanding, potentially leading to a requirement to update  the UKCP18 projections with new, and potentially different, advice. The probabilistic projections are designed to provide a primary tool for assessments of the widest range of  uncertainties in UKCP18, and generally show broader ranges of future climate than the global and regional  climate model projections. They can be an important tool for a variety of different types of risk assessment,  including when attempting to be robust against all simulated scenarios, and when used alongside other  information such as the global and regional projections of climate and of course, information on  vulnerabilities, adaptation options and risk tolerance. They may be especially useful for the avoidance of  overconfident decision-making. The probabilistic projections are derived from a statistical framework that  supports the formal application of observational constraints, and estimation of the relative likelihood of  specific outcomes. We emphasise again, that these are conditional on the knowledge, data, methods and  expert choices used to construct them. If a d ecision is sensitive to relative likelihood or focused heavily on  specific probability levels, then we recommend users test the sensitivity of their findings to the UKCP18  results. For instance by exploring the consequences of reasonable variations to the UKCP18 results,  including to probability levels.

"""What might UK sectoral planning face with changing seasonal rain patterns?""","['chunk: Precipitation, both rainfall and snowfall, can cause significant societal and economic impacts on various  timescales. Short, intense rainfall events (e.g. thunderstorms) can lead to pluvial or surface flooding as surface run-off  inundates small catchments and the urban landscape. Prolonged periods of excessive precipitation  saturates soil, increasing the risk of fluvial or river flooding. Above average precipitation for long periods can  ultimately lead to a raised water table, which can result in groundwater flooding in areas where the  geological characteristics are favourable. In the UK and Europe, flooding is one of the most economically  and socially disruptive natural hazards with impacts on transport, infrastructure and energy supply. Information on precipitation variability and future change is also critically important in water resource  management.

The variables primarily affected are snow  and winter temperature especially over Scotland, for which the existing 2.2km data should  not be used. Also affected but to a lesser extent are winter precipitation, hourly  precipitation extremes across the UK and wind extremes over the ocean and north-west  coastal regions, and for these variables the existing 2.2km data should be used with caution.  The variables unaffected are summer temperature including extremes and summer mean  precipitation.   •   New data with the error fixed will be issued, with a planned release for Spring 2021.  •   On fixing the error, the simulation of lightning is considerably improved, allowing it to be  potentially provided as a user diagnostic in the new release in 2021.  •   This report is aimed at more technical users of the 2.2km data, providing guidance on when  applications are likely unaffected by the error or where users should wait for the new 2.2km  data.   Summary  An error has been found within the UKCP 2.2km climate model in the scheme that represents graupel,  which are soft small ice pellets with higher densities and fall speeds than snow. Graupel is typically  smaller than hail and forms when supercooled water coats a snowflake. Subsequent testing has shown  that the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections (including for temperature, precipitation and wind) can still  provide important information for many applications related to climate change but there is a need to  update the user guidance on use of the UKCP 2.2km data, with additional caveats. Over the coming  months, we will provide new additional simulations from the UKCP 2.2km climate model with the error  fixed, which should ultimately be treated as the preferred dataset.    The graupel error emerged whilst having a detailed look at simulations performed with the same  version of the model over the Colorado mountains. The error was in the code that controls the  fraction of snow converted to graupel, rather than in the total snow/ice amount, and in general  resulted in too much snow being converted to graupel. In the operational weather forecast model,  graupel is included but the section of erroneous code is turned off, and thus operational weather  forecasts are not impacted. No other UKCP product is affected by the error, and top-level messages  from UKCP in terms of climate change in the UK (Lowe et al 2018) are not impacted.  Some rapid tests have been performed for one 2.2km ensemble member to look at the consequences  of the graupel code error for the UKCP Local simulations.

Whilst  many applications are unlikely to be strongly impacted by using the new data, we believe that issuing  new data will provide the widest access to all UKCP products (i.e. ensuring the same quality of data  for all locations and for all types of adaptation decision, consistent with our policy followed in earlier  generations of climate projections). The new data will also come with the benefi t of potentially  providing additional climate metrics that are not available at present. We reiterate that the UKCP  probabilistic, global and regional projections are unaffected by this issue, with no change to their use  guidance. Furthermore, we continue to recommend that UKCP products are used together, rather  than in isolation, in order to give the most complete picture of future climate.   Part 1: Advice on use of UKCP Local data  The UKCP Local 2.2km projections consist of an ensemble of 12 simulations at 2.2km resolution run  for 3 time periods (Kendon et al., 2019). The UKCP Local (2.2km) projections sit alongside a number  of other UKCP18 tools to look at climate change (Murphy et al., 2018, Lowe et al., 2018). These  include probabilistic projections, a set of 28 global 60km climate simulations and a set of twelve  regional 12km simulations. The UKCP Local (2.2km) projections are intended to be useful for impacts  assessments that require enhanced spatial detail or information on changes in extreme weather at  local and hourly timescales. However, they only downscale versions of the Hadley Centre climate  model and the RCP8.5 scenario, and so sample a narrower uncertainty range than the global or  probabilistic projections. It is important that users are aware of the other UKCP products and the  advantages of each for their application, and also that users consider the sensitivity of their  applications to  uncertainty in the UKCP outputs. Further guidance on which UKCP product to choose  is available from Fung et al. (2018a). The following advice is for those who have already used or are  planning to use UKCP Local (2.2km) data, and covers the use of precipitation, temperature, snow,  wind and lightning outputs.   The results reported in this technical note (see Part 2) show that fixing the graupel code error in the  single-member test leads to some differences that exceed the standard deviation across the 12- member UKCP 2.2km ensemble. Under the assumption that the other 11 ensemble members are  impacted similarly (although differences could be larger or smaller in other members that have the  same model physics but sample different large-scale conditions), we judge the impact of the graupel  code error to be significant compared to the ensemble spread, for some variables in some seasons,  and especially in some locations. Although the current UKCP Local (2.2km) data remains suitable for  many users dependent on application, to promote the widest access to all UKCP products in all  regions of the UK, the decision has been taken to rerun the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections with the  graupel code error fixed. These new data should be the preferred source for all new users. For  current users of t he existing UKCP 2.2km data, in many cases it is not necessary to rerun analysis  with the new data, except for specific variables and seasons (as outlined below).\nheading: graupel code error, the simulation of lightning is considerably improved, allowing it to be potentially |ukcp_graupel_technical_note.pdf\nfile_name: ukcp_graupel_technical_note.pdf\nsection_id: 594\nfile_id: 61']","The existing 2.2km data can still be used for many applications, but extra care is needed in the use of data for some variables and locations. The variables primarily affected are snow and winter temperature especially over Scotland, for which the existing 2.2km data should not be used. Also affected but to a lesser extent are winter precipitation, hourly precipitation extremes across the UK and wind extremes over the ocean and north-west coastal regions, and for these variables the existing 2.2km data should be used with caution.",multi_context,True,gpt-4-turbo,sections,,,,,
"""How do Atlantic Jet Stream positions affect long-term climate patterns in Europe?""","['chunk: The atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic and European region is highly variable from day to day.  Many methods exist to describe this variability, however one method which is particularly illustrative is  weather typing. In this approach a set of representative weather patterns are generated which describe the  main patterns of daily atmospheric circulation over a region. They can be considered to show typical  conditions, giving a simplified picture of the variety of conditions experienced. The set of patterns described here was generated by categorising daily mean sea-level pressure (MSLP)  (changes compared to the 1981-2000 average) into 30 weather patterns. Each day is classified by a  weather type value 1-30. This is an iterative process, in which a series of sets of patterns were evaluated by  meteorologists to ensure that a full range of circulation types affecting Europe were adequately represented  (Neal et al., 2016). These 30 weather patterns are also provided as an amalgamated set of 8 weather patterns. The 8 weather  patterns are generally considered to be sufficient for exploring long-term trends where subtle differences in  regimes are less important and they are shown in Figure 1. The larger set of 30 are more useful where greater  differentiation between weather regime characteristics are important. Figure 1  Observed mean sea level pressure anomaly or weather pattern for weather types (WT) 1-8, averaged over 1981-2000.

Shifting jet stream patterns can have a big impact on UK weather,  particularly by determining the position of the North Atlantic Storm track in winter. For example, read about  the influence of the jet stream on the unusually wet October 2019 ( https://blog.metoffice.gov. uk/2019/11/04/the-jet-stream-casts-its-shadow-over-the-uk-duringoctober/ ). The winter jet stream over the North Atlantic has 3 ‘preferred’ positions – at around 35-38°N, 45-47°N and  58-60°N  Woollings et al. (2010) . The position determines the path that weather systems and storms take  across the Atlantic. This tri-modal pattern, and the long-term average frequency at which the jet takes each  of the three positions, is reasonably well captured by the UKCP Global models 1  (Figure 1). Figure 2 illustrates the differences in rainfall patterns associated with a strong jet in each of the three  positions - when a strong jet is in the ‘North’ position (50-60°N) it brings wetter-than-average conditions to  the northern Europe (Scotland and Scandinavia); conversely in the ‘South’ position (30-40°N) it is Southern  Europe (Spain and Mediterranean Europe) that receive greater than average rainfall. The UK experiences  greater-than-average rainfall when a strong jet is in its ‘Mid’ position (40-50°N). It’s important to note that there is large year-to-year natural variability in the number of days when the jet is  in each of these three positions, which is one reason why some years are wetter and/or stormier than others  in the UK.

The frequency distribution is  a smoothed representation of the number of days that the jet sits within a given latitude interval during the period 1981-2000. 1  We’ve compared the climate model results with a historical quasi-observed dataset, ERA-Interim. These quasi-observed datasets are produced by  combining meteorological observations and a climate model to give a more complete picture of the climate during an observed period.

How do UKCP18 land projections combine models to forecast climate futures and uncertainties?,"['chunk: The probabilistic, global and regional projections that comprise the UKCP18 land projections are derived  from climate models which approximate the real climate system. Hence there are systematic differences  between climate model results and observations (i.e. biases). In addition, climate models neglect unknown  effects of missing earth system processes. While the combined evidence of UKCP18 covers a broad range  of potential future climate pathways, it remains possible that observed future changes could lie outside the  envelope of these. Future generations of climate models will be developed that reflect improved scientific  capabilities and understanding, potentially leading to a requirement to update the UKCP18 projections  resulting in new, and potentially different, advice. The probabilistic projections  We have designed the probabilistic projections to provide the primary tool for assessments of the ranges of  uncertainties in UKCP18. For a given emissions scenario, they provide information on known uncertainties in  future climate changes. In particular, the aim is to represent uncertainties consistent with the knowledge  incorporated in existing ensembles of climate model projections, plus the effects of internal climate  variability. They are derived from a statistical framework that supports the formal application of  observational constraints and estimation of the relative likelihood of specific outcomes. However, we  emphasise that they are conditional on the knowledge, data, methods and subjective choices used to  construct them. As such, they should not be confused with (for example) probabilistic weather forecasts,  which can be assessed in a frequentist sense through repeated trial and verification (e.g. Hamill, 1997).  Other researchers could arrive at different results if  they made different choices. For a more detailed  discussion see Section 2.1 of the Land Projections Science Report, (Murphy et al, 2018). The probabilistic projections typically show broader ranges of outcomes than the global and regional  projections. This enables assessments across a larger set of climate futures than relying on a small set of  future outcomes, e.g. only using the climate models from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project  (CMIP5) that fed into the 5 th  Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  The probabilistic format should not be misinterpreted as an indication of high confidence in the weight of  evidence behind specific outcomes. That is, future developments in our physical understanding of climate  change drivers and improvements in climate modelling capability could lead in the future to revised  projections giving different probabilities for changes in UK variables. The probabilistic projections should be  seen as a source of broad guidance that forms a useful starting point for risk assessments.  The global, regional, local and derived projections The global, regional and local projections provide flexible datasets derived directly from climate model  output. These have full spatial and temporal coherence and offer information on a wider set of variables  (that are physically consistent), metrics and time scales than is available from the probabilistic projections.  These projections provide storylines of climate futures that you can use to develop case studies, stress-test  your system and decision options. You can also use the global and regional projections to build confidence in  your use of the data, by providing opportunities to explain the future outcomes that they represent. For  example, the global model provides information on large-scale drivers that affect the patterns of weather  that we experience in the UK. Drivers include the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, a large system  of ocean currents that carries warm water from the tropics northwards into the North Atlantic.

"What was the preprocessing error in UKCP's Easy Aerosol ancillary gen, and its impact on seasonal radiative calculations?","['chunk: In addition to the graupel code error, a couple of other issues have been recently found that effect  the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections. Firstly, an error has been found in the calculation of grid box  latitude and longitude coordinates provided to the radiation scheme.  In the case of variable  resolution configurations like the UKCP CPM, the calculation was performed as if all grid boxes are  evenly spaced.  Consequently, the incoming solar radiation has a largely symmetrical error with not  enough incoming radiation in the North of the domain and too much in the South. The magnitude of  the error is largest in winter where it reaches 3.5 W m -2  for the UKCP 2.2km CPM domain.  Initial  results suggest that the impact on surface variables is minimal with surface temperature differences  less than 0.05ᵒC, nevertheless we plan to additionally fix this grid coordinate error in the new 2.2km  CPM runs.  Secondly an error has been found in the code used to generate Easy Aerosol (Stevens et al 2017)  ancillaries used in both the UKCP Regional (12km) and Local (2.2km) projections. The error was in  the pre-processing code that converts diagnostics output from the 60km GCM to Easy Aerosol input  files. It resulted in daylight hours weighting, which is used to calculate shortwave aerosol radiative  effects, being set at the value for September for all months, instead of varying month-by-month.  This led to too much shortwave aerosol impact in summer and not enough in winter. 10-year test  simulations were carried out to assess the impact of this daylight-hours error. In the RCM, the  impact was found to be small and less than the spread across the 12-member ensemble (except for  precipitation where local differences could be large reflecting just noise due to natural variability).  The impact was found to be greatest over central/eastern Europe, where future increases in  temperature may b e overestimated (by up to 1ᵒC in winter and 0.5ᵒC in summer) in the UKCP  Regional projections; over the UK impacts are much smaller (with maximum local impacts of 0.2- 0.3ᵒC). On this basis the error was judged to be not significant and there was no evidence to support  a rerun of the Regional (12km) projections. Similar results were found on assessing the impact of the  daylight-hours error in the CPM. Although the impact of the error is small, we plan to additionally fix  this error in the new 2.2km CPM runs. We note that this will introduce a small inconsistency in the  aerosol forcing between the 2.2km CPM and the 12km RCM, but Easy Aerosol only provides an  approximation of the real aerosol forcing (e.g. it ignores cloud-aerosol interactions, Stevens et al  2017) and thus is associated with significant uncertainty anyway.  We are also considering additional science changes to include before starting the full set of  experiments. Scientific understanding is continually moving forward, and we are considering going  beyond the state of understanding at the time of the original UKCP 2.2km release and in particular  to include some recent model improvements, where these changes are well tested and known to  lead to significant benefits. This includes adding new code which acts to melt graupel at the surface,  along with the multi-layer snow scheme. These changes will allow a more physical treatment of  graupel and mean that it can be included in the snowpack, rather than just being ignored by the  Joint UK Land-Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model (thereby breaking conservation of  water at the surface) as is the case in the original UKCP 2.2km CPM. Using the multi-layer snow  scheme, which is a more sophisticated treatment of snow and is now implemented operationally in  the UKV, has the added be nefit of increasing consistency between the 2.2km CPM and driving 12km  RCM (which uses the multi-layer snow scheme).   Testing of these additional science changes is underway and a decision from the UKCP project team  will be made which to include, once sufficient data is available to assess the science impact of the  new code in the UKCP configuration.\nheading: Additional changes and timeline for new runs |ukcp_graupel_technical_note.pdf\nfile_name: ukcp_graupel_technical_note.pdf\nsection_id: 620\nfile_id: 61']","The preprocessing error in UKCP's Easy Aerosol ancillary generation was that the daylight hours weighting, used to calculate shortwave aerosol radiative effects, was set at the value for September for all months, instead of varying month-by-month.

Introduction The project was developed to provide forestry practitioners, primarily in the UK, but also across Europe, with a means of identifying appropriate seed origins to enable the planting of species that are likely to be tolerant of future climate conditions. The information was to be made available in a web interface, the  Climate Matching Tool , that allowed foresters to access 12 km spatial resolution climate data for Europe and the Pacific Northwest. The project was funded by Forestry Commission with resources from the EU funded B4est Project. Figure 1. The  climate matching tool  in operation. A climate difference (CD) score closest to zero (darker red colours) are the areas have closest match to the selected site (denoted by the tree logo, here in eastern Scotland). The site comparison can be chosen based on: a) Precipitation only b) Temperature & diurnal range c) Precipitation, temperature & diurnal range For a range of future time periods and for one of two questions: 1. Which areas currently have my future climate? Or 2. Which areas will have my current climate in the future? Using The Climate Matching Tool The  Climate Matching Tool  is a web based tool that allows users to match the climatic conditions of sites of interest with future climates. For example, a forester in eastern Scotland can observe how their site might be analogous with northern Spain in the future. This allows the user to consider assisted migration (planting seeds of species from southerly latitudes) as a means of climate mitigation for key native and non native species. Users select their area of interest (eastern Scotland in Fig.1) and then choose the question, future time period and climate information. Future time periods extend out to 2079, as many trees planted today will have an intended lifespan of over 80 years (particularly for forests intended as carbon sinks) Users are presented with climate difference (CD) score with a score of zero matching the target climate conditions exactly. The heat map shows the distribution of these CD scores, to enable easy interpretation of the results and the target areas for potential new species.']",The Climate Matching Tool uses 12 km spatial resolution climate data to help forestry experts match the climatic conditions of sites of interest with future climates.

How do SMPs use future mapping and climate projections for coastal development and erosion management?,"['chunk: Local authorities normally take the lead in managing coastal  erosion risk, under the overview of the Environment Agency  (EA). The processes of this management range from local  projects through broader strategic studies to regional Shoreline  Management Plans (SMP) and national assessments. It is normal  for such studies to include mapping of future shore position across  diﬀerent epochs extending 100 years into the future; occasionally  this timeframe is much longer. Planning authorities will typically  refer to SMP mapping to decide whether a new coastal  development is allowable.', 'chunk: •  More work is needed to improve our understanding of the current and future risks of coastal flood events  associated with drivers of extreme coastal water levels, particularly storm surges and waves. This  includes elucidating the relationships between atmospheric storminess and extreme storm surge events  around the UK. The development of storyline approaches is a useful framework in this context and could  be used, for example, to explore the spread in changes in storminess over the UK and the associated  changes in future flood risk. We note that there is currently very active discussion on different types of  storyline approach among the research and stakeholder communities. •  Given the limitations of climate models to represent shelf sea processes, ocean dynamical downscaling  should be explored to extract more reliable information on the emergent patterns of oceanographic sea  level change. Downscaled simulations are also potentially a way to include realistic expressions of sea  level variability with the emergent climate change signals, which may offer increased utility to coastal  stakeholders.  •  If there is demand for more detailed information on sea level change beyond the 21 st  century, it would be  useful to generate extended time-horizon model projections using several different modelling  approaches that include suitably sophisticated process representation (such as the two-layer model  used in UKCP18).

What are the key steps to refine UKCP18 projections for accuracy and uncertainty coverage?,"['chunk: Both cases advocated sense-checking UKCP18 outputs, which  would involve three steps (technical advice and guidance may be  required for these): 1.  Evaluate projections against observations  – how well do the  models recreate the observed climate? The UKCP18 project  team will provide evidence and guidance to assist with this step. 2.  Bias correct  – models may do a satisfactory job of representing  weather patterns and changes over time but ‘absolute’ levels  of various parameters may be inaccurate. It is common for  statistical ‘corrections’ to be applied to account for these  systematic biases but they have their limitations.

"""What role does the Met Office Hadley Centre model play in UKCP Local Transient Projections under RCP8.5?""","['chunk: The UKCP Local Transient Projections are just one of a number of UKCP products. The UKCP Probabilistic,  Global (60km), Regional (12km) and Probabilistic Extremes products offer additional sources of  information for UK impacts (Fung et al., 2018, Murphy et al., 2020), useful in applications where the higher  horizontal resolution of UKCP Local is not required, or to provide wider context on large-scale drivers and/ or a more comprehensive sampling of uncertainty. The UKCP Local projections are driven exclusively by  variants of the Met Office Hadley Centre model and currently lack information from other international  climate models. They are also only for a single emissions scenario, RCP8.5. They therefore do not support a  probabilistic interpretation and provide a narrower sampling of uncertainty compared to the other UKCP  products. For applications focussing on local weather extremes, or requiring information on fine spatial  scales or at hourly time step, UKCP Local is expected  to be the primary source of information. However,  there are also cases where the other UKCP products might be more relevant. For example, the Probabilistic  Extremes product allows consideration of other emission scenarios and provides a wider sampling of  uncertainty. Where possible we recommend that the UKCP Local Transient projections are used in  combination with UKCP Global or UKCP Probabilistic, rather than in isolation, in order to give a more  complete picture of potential future changes.

The UKCP Local projections are driven exclusively by  variants of the Met Office Hadley Centre model and currently lack information from other international  climate models.

What do UKCP Local Projections suggest about seasonal climate changes and snow variability in the UK?,"['chunk: We have assessed the performance of the new UKCP Local Transient Projections in representing present- day temperature, precipitation, winds, circulation patterns, cloud, humidity, soil moisture and snow. We  have considered seasonal means, measures of variability and extremes, and trends compared to  observations. Regional timeseries are evaluated to illustrate temporal variability in key indicators and to  identify any inconsistencies between the 20y time-slices. These are named as follows TS1 = 1981-2000;  TS1.5 = 2001-2020; TS2 = 2021-40; TS2.5 = 2041-60; TS3 = 2061-80 (to ensure consistency with the  TS1, 2 and 3 definitions in the original UKCP Local projections, Kendon et al., 2021a). This provides the  evidence base to assess the credibility of the UKCP Local Transient Projections. Here we provide a brief  summary of the key results. There is consistent behaviour across time-slices for all variables considered. For 20-year seasonal means,  there is steadily increasing temperature, and increasing winter and decreasing summer precipitation across  time-slices (Figs 1-2). For the ensemble-mean, there are consistent increases or decreases in seasonal  mean pressure patterns, winds and cloud depending on region and season and steadily increasing specific  humidity (not shown). There is also decreasing soil moisture in summer and autumn (see below). UKCP  Local is also able to correctly capture the precipitation associated with key weather patterns influencing  the UK (Neal et al., 2016; Fig 3). There are some biases, for example there is an insufficient rain shadow in  the east under weather type 20 and too much rainfall in the south under weather type 9, but in general the  key differences in the amounts and spatial pattern of rainfall between weather types is well captured. Annual timeseries of UK-averaged values, showing the evolution of seasonal-mean temperature and  precipitation through time, show no apparent jumps in the timeseries from one time-slice to the next (Figs  4-5). The general trend also shows good agreement with observations. We note that we would not expect  the exact evolution of annual values to match between the UKCP Local simulations and observations, since  they have no knowledge of the observed atmospheric or ocean state (being driven by a global coupled  model). The standard member is shown in Figs 4 and 5 as illustrative of a single realisation, where the  degree of variability is directly comparable to the observations. The standard member corresponds to the  member where no perturbations have been applied to the driving model physics and is considered as   Source: Met Office © Crown Copyright 2023 www.metoffice.gov.uk Pg 4 of 31', 'chunk: •  Both models represent the spatial variability well across the UK in winter  (i.e. greater snowfall in northern and highland areas). •  The winter-to-winter temporal variability in falling snow is better represented in the RCM. •  The winter-to-winter temporal variability in lying snow is better represented in the CPM. The differences between the RCM and CPM are mainly due to the differences in the way the models simulate  snowfall and the improved representation of topography in the CPM (see Kendon et al, 2019a, Section 3.5  for further details). In the updated Local 2.2km projections (released July 2021), there is a much improved  representation of snowfall and lying snow at the surface compared to the original Local 2.2km projections  (released September 2019). In general this leads to greater consistency between the CPM and RCM. The updated Local (2.2km) model produces more snowfall over the Scottish mountains and less in the  vicinity of the northwest coastline of Scotland compared to the RCM. There is also more lying snow over high  ground in Scotland in the CPM. These differences are likely explained by the higher resolution of the CPM  leading to a better representation of mountains, and the ability of the CPM to better represent the  movement of convective showers inland. Therefore, the Local (2.2km) projections provide the best  information available on snow in the UKCP suite of products, due to the better representation of topography  and wintertime convective showers.

Results are available for five emissions scenarios (RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5, and  SRES A1B).    •  Under RCP8.5 emissions, the projections show future increases in median return levels in all seasons for  all variables. By 2070, the increase in median TXx relative to 1990 is 2.5°C in winter, and 3.7-4.3°C in  other seasons, based on UK averages of regional values.

How do GC3.05-PPE flux adjustments affect median bias in low-latitude marine areas vs. other model ensembles?,"['chunk: b.   Climatology in CMIP6 and UKCP-Global simulations   For surface air temperature, Figure 3 compares ensemble median biases in the GC3.05-PPE and  CMIP5-13 components of UKCP-Global against the median bias across 47 CMIP6 coupled models.  Results are presented for the 20-year average of 1981-2000, for December to February (DJF) and June to  August (JJA). The patterns of bias for CMIP6 and CMIP5-13 are broadly similar, indicating that in most  regions the systematic components of model error have the same sign. For example, both ensembles  show positive median biases in the marine stratocumulus regions off the western coasts of North and  South America and southern Africa. Bock et al. (2020) conclude that biases in the stratocumulus regions  arise partly from limited horizontal resolution, since these biases are smaller in higher resolution models  (e.g. Roberts et al., 2019). Both CMIP5-13 and CMIP6 also show a median warm bias over the Southern  Ocean and Kazakhstan (Fig. 3), while in DJF many parts of the northern hemisphere continental  landmasses show a cool bias.  In GC3.05-PPE the median cool bias in northern hemisphere winter is more pronounced and more  widespread than in the multi-model ensembles. The Southern Ocean warm bias is also larger, despite  the use of flux adjustments (absent from the multi-model ensembles). However, in many low-latitude  marine regions the median bias is smaller in GC3.05-PPE.

"""What underlies UKCP18's projections and integration of diverse data for climate estimates?""","['chunk: The approaches used in UKCP18 have been subject to a rigorous evaluation. The models used for the future  also simulate the present-day and the model results have been compared with observations. The physically  based models of the climate used in UKCP18 are based on the well-established laws of physics and the  latest understanding of how the climate system operates has been included in the projections. Further, an  independent peer review panel of scientific experts has provided guidance on the approaches and  influenced how the projections are made and presented. The panel contains many internationally renowned  experts chosen to cover the breadth of UKCP18 products. This panel, which has been in place throughout  most of the period of the UKCP18 production process, has been expanded for the final review of reports to  include additional experts. Their views on UKCP18 are summarised on the user website.  It is important for users to be aware that, although we have confidence that the projections represent a  significant improvement on UKCP09, there are still limitations in our ability to project 21 st  century weather  and climate. Furthermore, all simulations of the future are conditioned on both a limited number of  scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions and the particular methodologies we employ in UKCP18.  However, the limited number of greenhouse gas scenarios is less of an issue for the next two or three  decades than for later in the century. While the global and regional projections of future climate use the  latest climate models and are diverse they can not cover all potential future climate outcomes out to 2100  (or beyond in the case of sea level). Users making decisions based on any future climate information need to  take this into account in their decision-making frameworks. The 21 st  century projections presented in this report are produced for the RCP climate change scenarios.  The results are therefore subject to any inherent limitations of the assumed emissions scenarios.  For the climate simulations over land users need to note: •  The probabilistic projections make use of global climate simulations using climate models of many  different spatial resolutions and vintages. Like all climate models these replicate many aspects of the  observed climate but also show biases compared to observations. Furthermore, they do not explicitly  represent smaller-scale processes such as atmospheric convection. •  The probabilistic projections also adopt a particular set of methods including an approach to emulating  climate models, treatment of structural uncertainty and use of a particular simple energy balance  climate model. The approach also downscales results to the 25km scale using a statistical approach  based on a global model-regional model pairing from a single model structure. Each stage of the method  has many assumptions and relies on expert judgement. •  The probabilities represent the relative strength of evidence supporting different plausible outcomes for  UK climate, based on the climate models, physical insight, observational evidence and statistical  methodology used to produce them. However, they may not capture all possible future outcomes,  because, for example, some potential influences on future climate are not yet understood well enough to  be included in climate models.  Source: Met Office © Crown Copyright 2018 www.metoffice.gov.uk Pg 68 of 73', 'chunk: UKCP18 provides a number of tools to investigate climate variability and change over the UK land areas.  First, it provides a new set of probabilistic projections that combine information from several collections of  computer models, including those used to inform the IPCC 5 th  assessment (IPCC, 2013), with observations  using advanced statistical methodologies. The approach involves using many different variants of a  particular computer model of the climate (HadCM3) to simulate a wide range of different climate  outcomes; this is known as a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE). A statistical emulator is then set up to  estimate climate outcomes for a much greater number of climate model variants. This distribution of  outcomes is adjusted (both in the mean and the spread) by taking account of the diversity provided by  structurally different climate models feeding into the most recent IPCC climate assessment. Finally, the  projected outcomes are weighted by comparing the model simulat ions of historical climate with  observations from the real world, so that some model variants are down-weighted and others given more  weight. This is achieved within a well-defined formal Bayesian statistical framework. These estimates of the  ranges of future climate are available for several alternative future scenarios of emissions, including RCP2.6,  RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5. Unlike UKCP09, which focused on 30-year mean probabilistic projections, the  new UKCP18 projections are available for each month and season for each future year and so take better  account of year-to-year variability in climate, which can be very important for decision-making. This  broadens the probability estimates.  The significant advances of UKCP18 over previous probabilistic projections provided in UKCP09 are: the  inclusion of simulated natural interannual variability; the inclusion of models from the most recently  completed IPCC assessment report (the so called CMIP5 models, compared to CMIP3 models used in  UKCP09); a more comprehensive sampling of Earth System modelling uncertainty; and more up-to-date  observational constraints (including new metrics that account for the ocean heat uptake and atmospheric  carbon dioxide concentrations). UKCP18 also includes improvements to the detailed methodological  approach, including the statistical aspects of the methodology. The second component of UKCP18 is a new set of global climate model projections that allows users to look  at spatially coherent changes of the future at scales down to around 60km and a greater number of climate  metrics than the probabilistic projections. There are 28 projections of future climate for the RCP8.5 emissions  scenario, comprised of a set of 15 projections from the new Met Office Hadley Centre climate model  (HadGEM3-GC3.05) plus a set of 13 projections from models that informed the IPCC 5 th  assessment  (CMIP5). Together, the two sources of model projection provide a greater span of outcomes than either set of  models could alone. The GC3.05 simulations were produced by generating a perturbed parameter ensemble  (PPE) to yield different but plausible variants of the model. This set was filtered using comparisons with  observations, the scientific literature and expert judgement to leave models that give plausible simulations of  climate from 1900 to present, whilst max imising diversity of the spread in the future projections. The CMIP5  model projections were also filtered to retain only the most plausible models. The GC3.05 set is noticeably  warmer in the future global average than the CMIP5 set. However, both sets are compatible with the  statements made by the IPCC in the 5 th  assessment report about ranges of future warming for the RCP8.5  emission scenario. The spatial scale of the underlying models varies from around 150km for the coarsest  CMIP5 model projections down to 60km for the GC3.05 model projections, but for the convenience of users  the results have all been placed on the same 60km grid.

Here we analyze the performance of climate models published between 1970 and 2007 in projecting future global mean surface temperature (GMST) changes. Models are compared to observations based on both the change in GMST over time and the change in GMST over the change in external forcing. The latter approach accounts for mismatches in model forcings, a potential source of error in model projections independent of the accuracy of model physics. We ﬁnd that climate models published over the past ﬁve decades were skillful in predicting subsequent GMST changes, with most models examined showing warming consistent with observations, particularly when mismatches between model‐projected and observationally estimated forcings were taken into account.

In this paper we undertake a thorough evaluation of the performance of various climate models published between the early 1970s and the late 2000s. Speciﬁcally, we look at how well models project global warming in the years after they were published by comparing them to observed temperature changes. Model projections rely on two things to accurately match observations: accurate modeling of climate physics and accurate assumptions around future emissions of CO 2  and other factors affecting the climate. The best physics‐based model will still be inaccurate if it is driven by future changes in emissions that differ from reality. To account for this, we look at how the relationship between temperature and atmospheric CO 2  (and other climate drivers) differs between models and observations. We ﬁnd that climate models published over the past ﬁve decades were generally quite  accurate in predicting global warming in the years after publication, particularly when accounting for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric CO 2  and other climate drivers. This research should help resolve public confusion around the performance of past climate modeling efforts and increases our conﬁdence that models are accurately projecting global warming. 1. Introduction Physics‐based models provide an important tool to assess changes in the Earth's climate due to external forcing and internal variability (e.g., Arrhenius, 1896; IPCC, 2013). However, evaluating the performance of these models can be challenging. While models are commonly evaluated by comparing “hindcasts” of prior climate variables to historical observations, the development of hindcast simulations is not always independent from the tuning of parameters that govern unresolved physics (Gettelman et al., 2019; Mauritsen et al., 2019; Schmidt et al., 2017). There has been relatively little work evaluating the performance of climate model projections over their future projection period (referred to hereafter as model projections), as much of the research tends to focus on the latest generation of modeling results (Eyring et al., 2019). ©2019. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Many different sets of climate projections have been produced over the past several decades. The ﬁrst time series projections of future temperatures were computed using simple energy balance models in the early 1970s, most of which were solely constrained by a projected external forcing time series (originally, CO 2  con- centrations) and an estimate of equilibrium climate sensitivity from single‐column radiative‐convective equilibrium models (e.g., Manabe & Wetherald, 1967) or general circulation models (e.g., Manabe & Wetherald, 1975).

"""How does Forest Research's '90s tool assist in British forestry species selection considering climate variables?""","['chunk: The British forestry sector delivers a range of objectives ranging  from habitats, timber production to recreation. Many of the mature  forests in the landscape today were planted in the mid-20th century  prior to concerns that climate change might affect their long term  ability to deliver ecosystem services.  Today, the forest planning and management community across the  private and public sector are aware that tree species choice should  account for site conditions in current and future climates. Their  informed decisions should sustain tree species in the landscape  and also the ecosystem services they provide, such as timber   and recreation.  Traditionally, foresters use land or forest management plans to  decide which species they want to grow and when they will harvest  them – driven by the different growth rates for coniferous and  broadleaves species. As forest plantations are continuously felled  and replanted forest planners need to update plans and use tools  that can help them quickly assess which tree species can be the  most tolerant to prevailing average and extreme climate conditions  such as warmer temperatures or increased precipitation. The  typical planning horizon is around 50 years for conifers managed via  clearfell systems but can be as much as 150 years for broadleaved  species such as oak. Ecological Site Classification (ESC)  To support foresters’ decisions,  Forest Research developed ESC in the 1990s. ESC is delivered as a  computer-based tool for appraising tree species’ potential by soil,  accumulated temperature and other climatic variables.

"How do UKCP Probabilistic vs. Regional projections differ for summer rainfall trends in England, given varying emissions and model uncertainties?","['chunk: 2.1  Considerations when using UKCP for rainfall applications Emissions Uncertainty:  The pathway we take for the emission of greenhouse gases  depends on demographic and socio-economic development over time as well as  technological change and the implementation of policy commitments.  A range of  emissions scenarios can be used to sample this uncertainty. The UKCP Probabilistic  projections provide the broadest overview using a range of emissions scenarios. The Global,  Regional and Local projections only sample a high emissions scenario, RCP8.5. A selection of these  projections are available at global warming levels (GWLs), which partly overcomes the availability of only  RCP8.5. GWLs represent the increase in surface temperatures averaged over the globe expressed relative  to the pre-industrial period (1850–1900). Using GWLs allows the assessment of changes in rainfall when  global temperatures reach, 1.5°C, 2°C and 4°C. Several GWLs are assessed as we do not yet know which  level will be reached as this depends on future greenhouse gas emis sions choices and the sensitivity of   the climate system. Model Uncertainty:  There are two types of model uncertainty – parameter uncertainty  and structural uncertainty. Parameter uncertainty arises from the inability of climate  models to resolve every process within the climate system, requiring the use of physical  equations and parameters. In UKCP, parameter uncertainty is assessed within the Met  Office’s Hadley Centre model (GC3.05-PPE) by perturbing model parameters within  expert-specified ranges to develop a range of simulations of the future climate, called the Perturbed  Parameter Ensemble (PPE). Uncertainty can arise from the structure of the climate model itself which influences how sensitive the  model is to the emission forcings, as well as the spatial and seasonal patterns of change that are  determined by changes in the regional processes or dynamics. This type of uncertainty can be assessed by  using a range of climate models. The UKCP Probabilistic, Global products and Probabilistic Extremes  products use both the Hadley Centre climate model (GC3.05-PPE) and models from CMIP5 (CMIP5-13).   The Hadley Centre model has a higher climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases compared to other models.  The UKCP Regional and Local currently only include downscaled versions of the Hadley Centre climate  model and sample a narrower range of structural uncertainty, however they capture parameter uncertainty  from the PPE. Figure 1 compares seasonal mean changes in precipitation (%) across all UKCP products for  Scotland and England. Changes in summer precipitation in England show a co nsiderable drying trend in the  Local and Regional projections (following the driving GC3.05-PPE), whereas the CMIP5 simulations and the  UKCP Probabilistic projections indicate more modest reductions or small increases in rainfall. It should be  noted that additional UKCP Regional and Local simulations downscaling selected members from CMIP5 will  be made available in 2024. These will provide wider uncertainty context for impacts studies. The  EuroCORDEX-UK project , funded through the UK Climate Resilience Programme, offers a facility to   supplement the UKCP Regional projections with information from a broader range of high-resolution  climate simulations from the EuroCORDEX downscaling experiment.  The additional projections will provide  a more comprehensive sampling of uncertainty in the high resolution UKCP projections.

Large-scale modes of variability   We evaluate El Niño-Southern Oscillation events (Figure 8), Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV,  Figure 9) and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO, Figure 10) comparing UKCP-Global with results  from 58 CMIP6 models in Figs. 8 and 9, and 64 in Fig. 10. Our assessment is limited to a simple “top- down” comparison of the intensity of variability in the relevant index values, preceded by a brief survey  of current understanding of their properties and influences.  ENSO influences climate anomalies in many world regions (Trenberth and Caron, 2000), especially  in the tropics through its effects on the Walker circulation.  Teleconnections from ENSO to seasonal  European climate are weaker, but specific influences are revealed by detailed analysis of observations.  For example, Fereday et al. (2008) found negative seasonal correlations between El Niño and a  circulation pattern resembling the positive phase of winter NAO, except for November–December which  shows the opposite relationship. In addition, Toniazzo and Scaife (2006) found that only weak or  moderate El Niños show the canonical negative NAO response in winter, while the strongest events  drive high pressure to the west of Europe that results from a tropospheric wave train originating from  the tropical Atlantic.  The NAO and AMV indices are important drivers of variability in European climate (e.g. Hurrell et  al., 2003; Sutton and Dong, 2012; O’Reilly et al., 2017; Rousi et al., 2020). The positive (negative) phases  of NAO drive higher (lower) winter precipitation and temperatures in northern Europe. For AMV,  notable influences on the UK include (in the positive phase) dry precipitation anomalies in spring and  wet anomalies in summer. AMV also exerts broader influences on decadal and longer time scales that  include rainfall in northeast Brazil and the Sahel, Atlantic hurricanes and North American (as well as  European) summer climate (Knight et al., 2006).  AMV is associated with low-frequency variability in the ocean circulation in the North Atlantic  (Delworth and Mann, 2000), but understanding the relative influences of internally-generated and  externally-forced variability remains an active topic of research. Booth et al. (2012), Bellucci et al. (2017)  and Bellomo et al. (2018) identify an external influence from anthropogenic aerosol forcing in climate  model simulations of the 20 th  century, while evidence of volcanic influence is also reported in studies of  observations and models (e.g. Swingeduow et al., 2017; Mann et al., 2021).  Internal NAO-driven variability contributes significantly to uncertainty in projected European  anomalies during the next few decades, but in historical data the dominance of internal variability  makes it difficult to identify any potential forced signal (Deser et al., 2017). Blackport and Fyfe (2022) do  find positive trends in observed NAO and North Atlantic jet stream data from 1951-2020. These lie  outside (for the jet data) and at the top end of (for NAO data) ranges found in a large ensemble of  coupled model simulations.

"What uncertainties exist in probabilistic climate projections, given their methods and assumptions about warming?","['chunk: Additional caveats and limitations come with:  •  Derived projections. •  Extended exploratory time-mean sea level projections.  •  Tide and surge simulations. The derived projections over UK land areas use approximate methods to produce an estimate of RCP2.6  and global warming levels of 2 and 4 ° C (compared to pre-industrial). This introduces additional  uncertainties. One of the major assumptions is that we can use the climate model time series that reach  particular warming levels through the 21 st  century (transient) to inform a future that has reached a steady  warming level (stabilized). There is some evidence that future climate outcomes at a particular global  warming level can differ depending on whether that warming level is transient or stabilized (e.g. Ceppi et al,  2018). See UKCP18 Derived Scenarios Report (Gohar et al, 2018).  The extended exploratory time-mean sea level projections have much lower confidence than the 21 st   Century Projections. Consider these projections as sensitivity studies and do not interpret them as showing  the full range of post-2100 behaviour, or the most likely behaviour. The potential for additional sea level rise  from Antarctic dynamic ice discharge is even more uncertain on these time horizons, with some studies  suggesting several additional metres of rise by 2300 under RCP8.5.  The simulations of changes in tide and surge characteristics make the simple assumption of a fixed  coastline under all levels of future sea level rise.  10.  Take care when comparing/combining variables When carrying out analyses that consider more than one variable, ensure that any outcomes are consistent  and coherent in their representation of the changes. For the probabilistic projections, there is no spatial  coherence. For the global, regional, local and derived projections ensure that you choose variables from the  same member of the set of projections. For example, summer temperature from one member is unlikely to  be consistent with precipitation from another. Choosing a model based on being amongst the largest of the probabilistic climate changes in summer  does not necessarily translate into the same model being in such an extreme position in the winter  change results.   Source: Met Office © Crown Copyright 2018 www.metoffice.gov.uk Pg 5 of 6', 'chunk: We have designed the probabilistic projections to provide the primary tool for assessments of the ranges of  uncertainties in UKCP18. However, they may not capture all possible future outcomes. The set of global and UK future climates has limited sizes and whilst it does cover a range of futures (with  the Met Office set of global models providing the higher end of future global temperatures), it cannot  simulate every possible future climate. This is especially true of the regional model (and consequently the  convection-permitting model used in the local (2.2km) projections) which is not driven by any climate  model simulations that fed into IPCC AR5 (i.e. CMIP5 climate models). Neither the set based on global  models, or that based on regional and convection-permitting models have been designed to support  estimates of the relative likelihood of alternative outcomes within their ranges of response, nor have they  been constructed to replicate the probabilistic projections.  The 21 st  century surge and wave projections are based upon relatively small set of CMIP5 models. It is  unlikely that these simulations span the full range of CMIP5 model responses under climate change. In  particular, these projections should be viewed as indicative of the overall magnitude of changes we might see  over the 21 st  Century.

You should  interpret the probabilities as being an indication of how much the evidence from models and observations  taken together in our methodology support a particular future climate outcome.  The relative probabilities indicate how strongly the evidence from models and observations, taken together  in our methodology, support alternative future climate outcomes. There is more evidence for outcomes  near the centre of the distribution than in the tails, so we see unimodal (single-peaked) distributions. In  these, the relative probabilities for specific outcomes are typically much higher near the 50% cumulative  probability level (median) of the distribution, than for outcomes lying either below the 10% cumulative  probability level or above the 90% cumulative probability level.

"What was the preprocessing error in UKCP's Easy Aerosol ancillary gen, and its impact on seasonal radiative calculations?","['chunk: In addition to the graupel code error, a couple of other issues have been recently found that effect  the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections. Firstly, an error has been found in the calculation of grid box  latitude and longitude coordinates provided to the radiation scheme.  In the case of variable  resolution configurations like the UKCP CPM, the calculation was performed as if all grid boxes are  evenly spaced.  Consequently, the incoming solar radiation has a largely symmetrical error with not  enough incoming radiation in the North of the domain and too much in the South. The magnitude of  the error is largest in winter where it reaches 3.5 W m -2  for the UKCP 2.2km CPM domain.

Secondly an error has been found in the code used to generate Easy Aerosol (Stevens et al 2017)  ancillaries used in both the UKCP Regional (12km) and Local (2.2km) projections. The error was in  the pre-processing code that converts diagnostics output from the 60km GCM to Easy Aerosol input  files. It resulted in daylight hours weighting, which is used to calculate shortwave aerosol radiative  effects, being set at the value for September for all months, instead of varying month-by-month.  This led to too much shortwave aerosol impact in summer and not enough in winter. 10-year test  simulations were carried out to assess the impact of this daylight-hours error. In the RCM, the  impact was found to be small and less than the spread across the 12-member ensemble (except for  precipitation where local differences could be large reflecting just noise due to natural variability).  The impact was found to be greatest over central/eastern Europe, where future increases in  temperature may b e overestimated (by up to 1ᵒC in winter and 0.5ᵒC in summer) in the UKCP  Regional projections; over the UK impacts are much smaller (with maximum local impacts of 0.2- 0.3ᵒC). On this basis the error was judged to be not significant and there was no evidence to support  a rerun of the Regional (12km) projections. Similar results were found on assessing the impact of the  daylight-hours error in the CPM. Although the impact of the error is small, we plan to additionally fix  this error in the new 2.2km CPM runs. We note that this will introduce a small inconsistency in the  aerosol forcing between the 2.2km CPM and the 12km RCM, but Easy Aerosol only provides an  approximation of the real aerosol forcing (e.g. it ignores cloud-aerosol interactions, Stevens et al  2017) and thus is associated with significant uncertainty anyway.  We are also considering additional science changes to include before starting the full set of  experiments. Scientific understanding is continually moving forward, and we are considering going  beyond the state of understanding at the time of the original UKCP 2.2km release and in particular  to include some recent model improvements, where these changes are well tested and known to  lead to significant benefits. This includes adding new code which acts to melt graupel at the surface,  along with the multi-layer snow scheme. These changes will allow a more physical treatment of  graupel and mean that it can be included in the snowpack, rather than just being ignored by the  Joint UK Land-Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model (thereby breaking conservation of  water at the surface) as is the case in the original UKCP 2.2km CPM. Using the multi-layer snow  scheme, which is a more sophisticated treatment of snow and is now implemented operationally in  the UKV, has the added be nefit of increasing consistency between the 2.2km CPM and driving 12km  RCM (which uses the multi-layer snow scheme).   Testing of these additional science changes is underway and a decision from the UKCP project team  will be made which to include, once sufficient data is available to assess the science impact of the  new code in the UKCP configuration.\nheading: Additional changes and timeline for new runs |ukcp_graupel_technical_note.pdf\nfile_name: ukcp_graupel_technical_note.pdf\nsection_id: 620\nfile_id: 61']","The preprocessing error in UKCP's Easy Aerosol ancillary generation was that the daylight hours weighting, used to calculate shortwave aerosol radiative effects, was set at the value for September for all months, instead of varying month-by-month.

In general, the decreases in percentage terms are smaller in both falling and lying  snow in mountainous regions (e.g. Scottish Highlands) than in low-lying regions (e.g. southern England). •  There are differences in estimates of future snow between the Regional (12km) and Local  (2.2km)  projections. Decreases in both falling and lying snow (over Scottish mountains) are larger in the regional  projections compared to the local projections.

The differences between the RCM and CPM are mainly due to the differences in the way the models simulate  snowfall and the improved representation of topography in the CPM (see Kendon et al, 2019a, Section 3.5  for further details). In the updated Local 2.2km projections (released July 2021), there is a much improved  representation of snowfall and lying snow at the surface compared to the original Local 2.2km projections  (released September 2019). In general this leads to greater consistency between the CPM and RCM. The updated Local (2.2km) model produces more snowfall over the Scottish mountains and less in the  vicinity of the northwest coastline of Scotland compared to the RCM. There is also more lying snow over high  ground in Scotland in the CPM. These differences are likely explained by the higher resolution of the CPM  leading to a better representation of mountains, and the ability of the CPM to better represent the  movement of convective showers inland. Therefore, the Local (2.2km) projections provide the best  information available on snow in the UKCP suite of products, due to the better representation of topography  and wintertime convective showers.

Users  should be aware that both the Regional (12km) and Local (2.2km) projections underestimate uncertainties,  as they only downscale versions of the Met Office Hadley Centre model. Although the local projections can provide information on small-scale weather events in the future, they  should not be confused with an operational weather forecast, which provides information on weather that is  likely to be experienced in the next few days. Instead the local projections provide a set of plausible projections  of climate change for the UK, if we follow a high emission scenario (i.e. RCP8.5). In particular, they provide  information on the local effects of changes in the types of weather that may be experienced in the future.  The local projections sample a narrower range of potential future outcomes than the full set of global  projections. In particular, the regional climate models only downscale 12 members of the PPE-15 (and are in  turn downscaled using the CPM) and none of the CMIP5-13.

The only difference in the GMSL projections used in UKCP18 is that we update  the estimate of the sea level contribution from Antarctic ice dynamics following the work of Levermann et  al, (2014). In this section we present a brief synopsis of the AR5 methods and provide a comparison with  the UKCP18 GMSL projections for the 21 st  century. We refer the reader to Church et al, (2013) and the  associated supplementary materials (available at  http://www.climatechange2013.org/report/full-report/ )  for a more complete discussion.  The GMSL projections presented in AR5 (Church et al, 2013) include estimates of the contribution from: (i)  ocean thermal expansion; (ii) mass changes in the Greenland Ice Sheet; (iii) mass changes in the Antarctic  Ice Sheet; (iv) mass changes in other ice caps and glaciers; (v) changes in sea level related to projections of  groundwater extraction and reservoir impoundment. The ice sheet terms are further broken down into a  contribution from surface mass balance and a contribution from ice dynamics, resulting in a total of seven  individual components of GMSL change. There were three major advances in the sea level science reported  in AR5 compared to the previous IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4, Bindoff et al, 2007). The first was  the demonstration of closure of the GMSL budget, i.e. the summation of observation-based estimates of  terms (i) - (v) was consistent with an independent estimate of GMSL change based on a tide-gauge  reconstruction for the period 1971-2008 (Church et  al, 2011). The second was the demonstration of better  agreement between process-based model estimates of GMSL change and observations. The third was the  inclusion of scenario-independent estimates of the contribution from ice dynamics (i.e. changes in the flow  of ice into the ocean) for both Greenland and Antarctica, which led to systematically larger GMSL  projections than were reported in IPCC AR4, as discussed by Palmer et al, (2016). The AR5 processed-based GMSL projections are based upon the output of 21 CMIP5 (Taylor et al, 2012)  global climate models under the Representative Concentration Pathway climate change scenarios (RCPs;  Meinshausen et al, 2011).

What are the challenges in handling extreme precipitation projections with scaling and transformation in the UKCP18?,"['chunk: A.1  Occurrence of implausible precipitation projections In the precipitation realizations released in 2018, statistical processing gave rise to the occurrence of a  small fraction of unphysical negative precipitation events (projected drying exceeding 100%), particularly  for locations in southern UK during summer with strong forcing scenarios. This arose from a linear scaling  employed in the method (see Appendix B), applied to percentage precipitation changes normalised by  changes in global mean surface temperature (GMST). Negative precipitation amounts occasionally  resulted, since this scaling is not mathematically constrained to remain above -100%. The potential for  unphysical values increases in cases where large GMST responses combine with a strong normalised  drying signal, and when sampled uncertainties associated with natural climate variability, emulation,  scaling and structural errors (Appendix B) are large. Since we make annual projections, the temporal  variability can be particularly large (especially at the 25km scale). F or realizations featuring a strong  mean drying, individual years with reductions exceeding -100% therefore become possible. For the  original UKCP18 projections these unphysical realizations were clipped at -100%. An alternative is to apply a logarithmic transform to the precipitation variable, prior to statistical  processing. Although this eliminates occurrences of drying exceeding -100%, it can give rise to the  generation of implausible wet extremes for individual years in some realizations. Figure 2.5b shows one  example. This arises from a combination of factors. Firstly, variability in the projections is simulated by  resampling the residual error obtained for the downscaling regression relationships used to map the GCM  response to regional scales (Section 2.5). This uncertainty is then sampled independently of the mean  projected change, which can occasionally lead to combinations of high variability and weak response that  are not necessarily present in the underlying climate model data. In principle, this residual variability in log  coordinates could depend weakly on response, but with only eleven RCM simulations available (Appendix  B.2) we are unable to quantify such relationships.  In addition, the exponential operator, applied to invert  the log transform when making the final projections, is very sensitive for positive values. When applied at  the wet end of the distribution, statistical uncertainty can therefore inflate to implausible values when  converting to percentage change. Below, we describe a method of combining use of transformed and  untransformed calculations, to circumvent the issues outlined above. A.2  Merging scaled log and scaled percent projections To avoid statistically generated unphysical values below -100% in the annual precipitation realizations,  scaled log projections are preferred, while to avoid implausible wet extremes the converse applies and  scaled percent projections are favoured. To resolve these issues, we implement a conditional selection of  the two transforms to create final merged distributions. Two projections are made for precipitation at  each grid point and season, one using percentage change and one using the scaled log transform  approach. The scaled log or scaled percent projection is selected separately for each statistical  realization using the following set of rules. •  For the scaled log realizations, individual annual anomalies are first inverted (using Eq.2) to recover  percentage values. •  For the scaled percent projections, any individual years showing drying exceeding -100% are then reset  to the inverse scaled log value for the corresponding year.

"How does EVT aid in estimating rare climate event probabilities, considering methodology and data techniques?","['chunk: Extreme value theory (e.g. Coles, 2001) is used in climate research to derive probability distributions that  describe the expected occurrence of rare events (e.g. IPCC, 2012). Such events lie in the far upper or lower  tails of the full distribution of values for the relevant variable, for example daily temperature maxima that  occur less than once or twice per season. Using EV distributions compensates for sampling issues, by  supporting estimates of probability for events that may not be present in the relatively short periods of data  used to calibrate the distributions. A key assumption is that the chosen EV distribution provides an accurate  representation of the complete probability distribution of the relevant events.  Alternative approaches are available to estimate parameters of EV distributions. The block maximum  method involves using the most extreme value within each of a set of distinct blocks of data. Here, we  provide projections for the meteorological seasons (December to February, March to May, June to August  and September to November). For summer, for example, this would involve picking the highest value of TXx,  Rx1day or Rx5day from each summer over a set of consecutive years.  This method has been used in  conjunction with the generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution in several climate change papers,  including the Brown et al. (2014) study that forms the basis of our approach here. It has the advantage of  avoiding the need to select a threshold to define an extreme event, but restricts the size of the data sample  to one event per season. In the present application, therefore, we use an alternative method: peaks over threshold (PoT). This  involves using all events exceeding a specified threshold in a given season, thus considering more of the  data, and avoiding the risk of missing multiple extremes that may occur in close proximity. The PoT  approach also excludes any seasons which happen not to contain any extreme events. The results depend  on the choice of threshold, which is a subjective decision. We select thresholds designed to capture 3% of  events per season, thus seeking a balance between increasing sample size and capturing genuine extremes.  Following Brown et al. (2008), the number of events is assumed to follow a Poisson process, and the  magnitude of exceedances a generalised Pareto distribution (e.g. Katz et al., 2002). The expected number of exceedances above a level x, conditional on x exceeding the chosen threshold, is  parameterised as: (1) where  µ ,  σ  and  ξ  are the location, scale and shape parameters (e.g. Coles, 2001). With this choice of  formulation, the above EV parameters are equivalent to those used in the GEV distribution for block maxima.  We therefore use the same notation as Brown et al (2014), but using threshold exceedances rather than  block maxima to calibrate the parameters.

"""What enhancements in CPM_new boost its extreme weather and local climate prediction accuracy?""","['chunk: •  For applications focussing on extremes, particularly those requiring information on fine spatial scales, the  RCM and CPM_new products are expected to be the primary source of information.  For daily  temperature extremes, these should be used alongside the UKCP Global projections to give a more  comprehensive uncertainty range. For heavy daily precipitation events, CPM_new projections are more  reliable especially in summer, due to the better representation of convection. For hourly precipitation  including extremes, projections from convection parameterised models are unreliable and so users  should only use the CPM_new projections. However, the CPM_new projections likely underestimate the  uncertainty range. •  CPM_new (as is the case for CPM_orig) provides information on changes in hourly precipitation and for  local areas, including a better representation of changes over cities (due to the higher spatial resolution  and more sophisticated urban scheme) and over regions of complex terrain. This information can be used  in local decision making, for example in relation to urban flooding for contingency planners.  •  For surface winds, CPM_new projections differ from the RCM projections. Both projections are judged  equally plausible, but some added value is expected from the CPM in terms of representing changes over  mountains and coastal regions. •  The Local (2.2km) and Regional (12km) projections sample a narrower uncertainty range than the  Probabilistic and Global projections, as they currently lack information from other international climate  models. Where possible, we recommend that the CPM_new projections are used in combination with  other UKCP products, rather than in isolation, in order to give the most complete picture of future  climate. •  Table 1 summarises advice on use of the new 2.2km reruns compared to the original UKCP Local (2.2km)  projections and other UKCP18 products by impact sector. Present-day performance  •  The ability of the CPM to simulate several aspects of the present-day climate has been verified by  comparing the model results with observations of the real world. In general, this along with the improved  representation of convection in the CPM, gives us confidence in its ability to project future changes to  extreme weather events at local and hourly scales. •  The new 2.2km reruns (CPM_new) are considerably colder than the original UKCP Local (2.2km)  simulations (CPM_orig) in winter. This exacerbates cold biases in the north of the UK, for winter mean  temperature and cold winter days. CPM_new is also wetter in winter than CPM_orig, particularly over  high terrain, leading to slightly increased biases for mean and heavy daily precipitation. Although these  biases have increased, we have greater confidence in CPM_new compared to CPM_orig, since differences  can be traced to fixing the graupel code error. •  The representation of heavy summer precipitation and hourly precipitation extremes has considerably  improved in the new 2.2km reruns, with the tendency for the CPM to overestimate extreme hourly  precipitation reduced (by about 20%). •  CPM_new has less snowfall and more lying snow compared to the original 2.2km runs, which is a  considerable improvement and directly relates to the improved treatment of graupel and the snowpack.

Here we examine how well the CPM represents the present-day climate compared to the  driving 12km RCM (Section 3). We mainly consider temperature and precipitation, including extremes  such as hot summer days and heavy downpours. •  In winter, the RCM is too cold in the north of the UK and too warm in the south, whilst the CPM gives  better agreement with observations. The CPM also better represents cold winter days and the number  of intense cold spells in the north UK in the present-day. In summer, the CPM is warmer than the RCM,  giving better agreement with observations in the north but not in the south where it has a tendency for  hot days to be too hot. These model differences are likely due to differences in the representation of  snow (less lying snow in the CPM in winter), cloud (less cloud in the CPM) and the tendency for soil to be  drier in the CPM. •  The CPM gives a significantly better representation of how rainfall varies day-to-day and hour-to-hour. In  particular, rainfall is too persistent in the RCM, which leads to too much overall rainfall. There are fewer  wet days in the CPM in better agreement with observations, although the CPM has too few wet days in  the far south in summer. The CPM better simulates heavy rainfall in winter and over mountains. In  summer, away from mountains, there is a tendency for heavy events to be too heavy in the CPM,  resulting in poorer agreement with observations than the RCM. In common with climate models more  generally, the RCM is unable to capture short intense downpours that can lead to flash flooding. Such  events are more realistically captured in the CPM, although again they tend to be too heavy. These  improvements in the CPM are due to the better representation of convection, and also of mountains and  coastlines.

How does adjusting the graupel auto-conversion in the UKCP 2.2km model affect lightning and snowpack representation?,"['chunk: An error was found within the UKCP 2.2km climate model in the microphysics code that represents  graupel. Graupel is a second category of ice with higher densities and fall speeds found in convective  cloud (Forbes and Halliwell, 2003). It is included in the 2.2km convection-permitting model (CPM),  but not in the 12km regional model (where instead all ice precipitation is diagnosed uniquely as  snow, with no graupel category). The error was in the graupel auto-conversion term, which controls  the fraction of snow converted to graupel . In general, it has resulted in too much snow being  converted to graupel.  Graupel is used to calculate lightning using the McCaul et al. (2009) lightning prediction scheme, and  so this graupel error impacts the simulation of lightning. We note that lightning data was not issued  from the original UKCP Local 2.2km projections, due to concerns over its verification, likely related to  the graupel code error. Therefore, fixing the graupel code error creates the potential to now provide  lightning data as a user diagnostic.  Graupel is in the snowfall output diagnostics, but since the error was in the term that converts  between hydrometeor types rather than in the absolute amount of ice/snow, the impact on total  precipitation is smaller. Following operational practice at the time, graupel was ignored by the land  surface model JULES in the UKCP CPM, and so was not included in the snowpack (Kendon et al.,  2019). This setting was recommended due to the tendency for the convection-permitting model to  produce too much small graupel, which if included in the snowpack would lead to an overestimation  of lying snow. The consequence of this is that, since the graupel error in general meant more snow  was converted to graupel, its effect was to reduce the snowpack.  The error has been found to have been present between Unified Model (UM) versions 10.3 and 11.3  inclusive (operational between 2016 and 2020) and affects model runs where both of the following  criteria are true: (1) prognostic graupel is in use; and (2) a temporary logical switch  l_fix_mphys_diags_iter is switched on. Operational numerical weather prediction (NWP)  configurations are thus unaffected by the error since global atmosphere (GA) model configurations  do not use prognostic graupel, and regional atmosphere (RA) model configurations (including the UK  forecast model, UKV) have l_fix_mphys_diags_iter switched off. However, this temporary logical was  switched on in the UKCP 2.2km CPM to be consistent with the driving 12km regional climate model  (RCM) and 60km global climate model (GCM). This should have been a null change since the  l_fix_mphys_diags_iter temporary logical is only intended to affect models that use sub-stepping in  the microphysics scheme, which is not the  case in regional models such as the UKCP CPM.  Unfortunately, turning it on led to an erroneous section of the microphysics code being activated.   The error was detected following a detailed investigation of some simulations performed with the  same version of the model over the Colorado mountains. It was not found in the UKCP simulations  since much less precipitation falls as snow over the UK, and the impact on total precipitation is small.  In the Colorado simulations, it was found that there was nearly as much graupel as snow, which does  not agree with observations. As well as graupel amounts, the code error was found to impact  lightning flash rates, some land surface diagnostics and does change the evolution of the model,  albeit in a relatively minor way. These impacts over the Colorado mountains are expected to be  reduced over the UK, due to the comparatively lower snowfall amounts, but need to be quantified  and taken into account by users of UKCP 2.2km results.  We note that in addition to the graupel code error above, ongoing research is underway within the  Met Office on improving the representation of graupel within the operational UKV model (Field et\nheading: Part 2: Technical description of graupel code error |ukcp_graupel_technical_note.pdf\nfile_name: ukcp_graupel_technical_note.pdf\nsection_id: 616\nfile_id: 61', 'chunk: graupel code error, the simulation of lightning is considerably improved, allowing it to be potentially  provided as a user diagnostic in the new release; representing an enhancement for users.

The new data will also come with the benefi t of potentially  providing additional climate metrics that are not available at present.

These  include probabilistic projections, a set of 28 global 60km climate simulations and a set of twelve  regional 12km simulations. The UKCP Local (2.2km) projections are intended to be useful for impacts  assessments that require enhanced spatial detail or information on changes in extreme weather at  local and hourly timescales. However, they only downscale versions of the Hadley Centre climate  model and the RCP8.5 scenario, and so sample a narrower uncertainty range than the global or  probabilistic projections. It is important that users are aware of the other UKCP products and the  advantages of each for their application, and also that users consider the sensitivity of their  applications to  uncertainty in the UKCP outputs. Further guidance on which UKCP product to choose  is available from Fung et al. (2018a). The following advice is for those who have already used or are  planning to use UKCP Local (2.2km) data, and covers the use of precipitation, temperature, snow,  wind and lightning outputs.   The results reported in this technical note (see Part 2) show that fixing the graupel code error in the  single-member test leads to some differences that exceed the standard deviation across the 12- member UKCP 2.2km ensemble. Under the assumption that the other 11 ensemble members are  impacted similarly (although differences could be larger or smaller in other members that have the  same model physics but sample different large-scale conditions), we judge the impact of the graupel  code error to be significant compared to the ensemble spread, for some variables in some seasons,  and especially in some locations. Although the current UKCP Local (2.2km) data remains suitable for  many users dependent on application, to promote the widest access to all UKCP products in all  regions of the UK, the decision has been taken to rerun the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections with the  graupel code error fixed. These new data should be the preferred source for all new users. For  current users of t he existing UKCP 2.2km data, in many cases it is not necessary to rerun analysis  with the new data, except for specific variables and seasons (as outlined below).\nheading: graupel code error, the simulation of lightning is considerably improved, allowing it to be potentially |ukcp_graupel_technical_note.pdf\nfile_name: ukcp_graupel_technical_note.pdf\nsection_id: 594\nfile_id: 61']","Adjusting the graupel auto-conversion term in the UKCP 2.2km model affects the representation of lightning and snowpack by causing more snow to be converted to graupel, which impacts the simulation of lightning and reduces the snowpack.",multi_context,True,gpt-4-turbo,sections,,,,,

What methods combine observations and models to project future climates in UKCP18?,"['chunk: UKCP18 provides a number of tools to investigate climate variability and change over the UK land areas.  First, it provides a new set of probabilistic projections that combine information from several collections of  computer models, including those used to inform the IPCC 5 th  assessment (IPCC, 2013), with observations  using advanced statistical methodologies. The approach involves using many different variants of a  particular computer model of the climate (HadCM3) to simulate a wide range of different climate  outcomes; this is known as a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE). A statistical emulator is then set up to  estimate climate outcomes for a much greater number of climate model variants. This distribution of  outcomes is adjusted (both in the mean and the spread) by taking account of the diversity provided by  structurally different climate models feeding into the most recent IPCC climate assessment. Finally, the  projected outcomes are weighted by comparing the model simulat ions of historical climate with  observations from the real world, so that some model variants are down-weighted and others given more  weight. This is achieved within a well-defined formal Bayesian statistical framework. These estimates of the  ranges of future climate are available for several alternative future scenarios of emissions, including RCP2.6,  RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5. Unlike UKCP09, which focused on 30-year mean probabilistic projections, the  new UKCP18 projections are available for each month and season for each future year and so take better  account of year-to-year variability in climate, which can be very important for decision-making. This  broadens the probability estimates.  The significant advances of UKCP18 over previous probabilistic projections provided in UKCP09 are: the  inclusion of simulated natural interannual variability; the inclusion of models from the most recently  completed IPCC assessment report (the so called CMIP5 models, compared to CMIP3 models used in  UKCP09); a more comprehensive sampling of Earth System modelling uncertainty; and more up-to-date  observational constraints (including new metrics that account for the ocean heat uptake and atmospheric  carbon dioxide concentrations). UKCP18 also includes improvements to the detailed methodological  approach, including the statistical aspects of the methodology. The second component of UKCP18 is a new set of global climate model projections that allows users to look  at spatially coherent changes of the future at scales down to around 60km and a greater number of climate  metrics than the probabilistic projections. There are 28 projections of future climate for the RCP8.5 emissions  scenario, comprised of a set of 15 projections from the new Met Office Hadley Centre climate model  (HadGEM3-GC3.05) plus a set of 13 projections from models that informed the IPCC 5 th  assessment  (CMIP5). Together, the two sources of model projection provide a greater span of outcomes than either set of  models could alone. The GC3.05 simulations were produced by generating a perturbed parameter ensemble  (PPE) to yield different but plausible variants of the model. This set was filtered using comparisons with  observations, the scientific literature and expert judgement to leave models that give plausible simulations of  climate from 1900 to present, whilst max imising diversity of the spread in the future projections. The CMIP5  model projections were also filtered to retain only the most plausible models. The GC3.05 set is noticeably  warmer in the future global average than the CMIP5 set. However, both sets are compatible with the  statements made by the IPCC in the 5 th  assessment report about ranges of future warming for the RCP8.5  emission scenario. The spatial scale of the underlying models varies from around 150km for the coarsest  CMIP5 model projections down to 60km for the GC3.05 model projections, but for the convenience of users  the results have all been placed on the same 60km grid. A set of global projections was not provided as part  of UKCP09 and this new product was requested by users to allow the investigation of international impacts,  including those that then affect the UK, such as through international food availability or price.

"""What factors affect snow representations in UK's RCM and CPM?""","['chunk: •  Both models represent the spatial variability well across the UK in winter  (i.e. greater snowfall in northern and highland areas). •  The winter-to-winter temporal variability in falling snow is better represented in the RCM. •  The winter-to-winter temporal variability in lying snow is better represented in the CPM. The differences between the RCM and CPM are mainly due to the differences in the way the models simulate  snowfall and the improved representation of topography in the CPM (see Kendon et al, 2019a, Section 3.5  for further details). In the updated Local 2.2km projections (released July 2021), there is a much improved  representation of snowfall and lying snow at the surface compared to the original Local 2.2km projections  (released September 2019). In general this leads to greater consistency between the CPM and RCM. The updated Local (2.2km) model produces more snowfall over the Scottish mountains and less in the  vicinity of the northwest coastline of Scotland compared to the RCM. There is also more lying snow over high  ground in Scotland in the CPM. These differences are likely explained by the higher resolution of the CPM  leading to a better representation of mountains, and the ability of the CPM to better represent the  movement of convective showers inland. Therefore, the Local (2.2km) projections provide the best  information available on snow in the UKCP suite of products, due to the better representation of topography  and wintertime convective showers. What do you need to be aware of? This factsheet details the biases in the data, though direct comparison with observations is difficult. Users  should be aware that both the Regional (12km) and Local (2.2km) projections underestimate uncertainties,  as they only downscale versions of the Met Office Hadley Centre model. Although the local projections can provide information on small-scale weather events in the future, they  should not be confused with an operational weather forecast, which provides information on weather that is  likely to be experienced in the next few days. Instead the local projections provide a set of plausible projections  of climate change for the UK, if we follow a high emission scenario (i.e. RCP8.5). In particular, they provide  information on the local effects of changes in the types of weather that may be experienced in the future.  The local projections sample a narrower range of potential future outcomes than the full set of global  projections. In particular, the regional climate models only downscale 12 members of the PPE-15 (and are in  turn downscaled using the CPM) and none of the CMIP5-13.

"What changes were made to UKCP18 sea-level projections for a new baseline, and how do they affect regional forecasts by 2100?","['chunk: Time-mean Sea-level Projections  Update: Technical Note 1. Summary  In August 2022, an issue was discovered with the UKCP18 processing code, which meant that the  adjustment needed to convert from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth  Assessment Report (AR5) baseline of 1986-2005 to the baseline period of 1981-2000 used in UKCP18  was not fully implemented for the site-specific time-mean sea-level projections. This issue has now been  resolved and sea-level projection datasets updated accordingly. The update results in about a 1 cm (or   0.01 m) increase for all UKCP18 site-specific sea-level projections over all timescales (e.g., projected   sea-level rise at 2030 + 1 cm, projected sea-level rise at 2100 + 1 cm). While this does affect headline  projection ranges at 2100 by + 0.01 m, the change is small and unlikely to be decision relevant. UKCP   users are encouraged to adopt the updated projections where this is practical. The updated data will be   the default version made available via CEDA and the UKCP User Interface from Ma rch 2023. 2. Description of the issue  The UKCP18 time-mean sea-level projection methods are rooted in CMIP5 climate model simulations that  are expressed relative to a baseline period of 1986-2005 (M. Palmer et al., 2018; M. D. Palmer et al., 2020).  It was therefore necessary to apply a small adjustment to these sea-level projections to express them  relative to the 1981-2000 baseline as described in section A1.1.1 of the UKCP18 Marine Report:    “Since the IPCC AR5 GMSL projections were formulated relative to a baseline period of 1986-2005 it is      necessary to carry out a small adjustment to the component time series to provide projections across       UKCP18 for a common baseline period of 1981-2000. This is achieved on the basis of the average       difference between the two baseline periods computed using four tide-gauge reconstructions of GMSL      (Church & White, 2011; Hay et al., 2015; Jevrejeva et al., 2014; Ray & Douglas, 2011). The result is an       offset of +0.011m for the total sea level, which is then applied across components according to the       proportion of sea level change that each accounts for in the first decade of the projections (assuming that     these are representative of the earlier period). These proportions are: 40.5% for Thermal Expansion; 9.5%      for Antarctica; 12.5% for Greenland; 27% for Glaciers and 10.5% for Land Water.”  While this adjustment was successfully applied for the UKCP18 global mean sea level (GMSL) projections,   a flaw in the processing code meant that this adjustment was not carried across to the site-specific UK  sea-level projections.

Projections of time-mean sea level are presented as yearly  values over the 21 st  century. The potential for changes in storm surges and wave climate over the 21 st   century are discussed in sections 3.2 and 3.3, respectively.  The UKCP18 time-mean sea level projections are rooted in the materials and methods described in the  IPCC AR5 (Church et al, 2013) (see section A1.1 for a full description). Following the approach of the IPCC  AR5, we present a range of future sea level rise for any given scenario on the basis of the 5 th  and 95 th   percentiles of the underlying process-based model projections. IPCC AR5 referred to this as the “likely  range” based on their expert judgement that there was a  ⅔  chance of sea level rise falling within this model  range, for a given scenario. The UKCP18 interpretation of the projection ranges presented in this report is  that there may be a greater than 10% chance that the real-world response lies outside these ranges and  that this likelihood cannot be accurately quantified.  In the following sections, we present projections of global mean sea level and show how the UKCP18 results  differ from the projections presented in the IPCC AR5 (section 3.1.1). We also discuss the potential for  accelerated sea level rise from Antarctic land-based ice loss, which is a topic that has received a lot of  attention since the publication of the IPCC AR5 (section 3.1.2). Regional coastal projections for the UK,  which are derived from our GMSL projections, are presented in section 3.1.3.  3�1�1 Global mean sea level (GMSL) projections  The UKCP18 global mean sea level (GMSL) projections differ from the IPCC AR5 projections for two  reasons: (i) we use a baseline period of 1981-2000 rather than 1986-2005; (ii) we include updated  estimates of the contribution from Antarctic ice dynamics, following Levermann et al, (2014; see section  A1.1). The change of baseline period results in a small +0.01m increase in projected values of GMSL. The  change in Antarctic ice dynamics brings about more substantive changes to the GMSL projections,  systematically increasing the projections and in particular, raising the value of the 95 th  percentile (i.e. the  upper bound of the likely range). The 2100 values for the IPCC AR5 and UKCP18 are summarised in Table  3.1.1. A comparison of the UKCP18 projection for RCP4.5 and the available satellite altimeter observations  shows good agreement in the contemporary rates of GMSL change (figure 3.1.2).

How does fixing the graupel code error affect future precipitation return level comparisons with original ensemble variability?,"['chunk: As above, the results here are based on using 19 years of data from a single ensemble member, and  so the estimation of return levels is subject to uncertainty. Therefore, we focus on relatively modest  extremes, specifically the 2-year and 5-year return levels of hourly and daily precipitation. In order  to assess whether the impact of the graupel code error is significant, we compare differences on  fixing the graupel with the spread across the original 12-member CPM ensemble. The key results are  as follows:  Hourly precipitation extremes:  •   The graupel code error has a significant impact on present-day return levels of hourly  precipitation extremes, even in summer, and a smaller but significant impact on future changes.  •   Present-day 2-year and 5-year return levels are reduced by about 20% on average across the UK  on fixing the graupel code error. This is the case on using data from all seasons and on using data  just from summer (which for hourly extremes largely dominates the all-year result, Figs 17 & 18).  The magnitude of the differences on fixing the graupel code error are larger than the original  UKCP CPM ensemble spread across almost all of the UK (for the 5-year return level the UK- average difference on fixing the graupel is 3.3 mm/h compared to an ensemble standard  deviation of 1.6 mm/h, Fig 17).  •   Future increases in 2-year and 5-year return levels are slightly greater (29% increase becomes  36% increase for 5-year return level) on fixing the error (Fig 19). In the case of the 5-year return  level, these differences are of a similar magnitude to the original UKCP ensemble spread in  future changes (Fig 19). Similar results are seen for summer (Fig 20): in this case the ensemble  spread is larger, but the impact of fixing the error can still exceed the ensemble standard  deviation locally.  •   Preliminary results looking at the 10-year return level of hourly precipitation extremes (not  shown) suggest that the impact of the graupel code error on the 10-year return level is very  similar to that for the 5-year return level with about a 20-25% reduction in the present-day  value, an increase in the future change (from 28% to 36%), and the difference in uplifts of a  similar magnitude to the ensemble standard deviation. With only 19-years of data from a single  ensemble member, it is not possible to investigate the impact of the graupel code error on  longer return period events.  •   The above results indicate that there is a significant impact of the graupel code error on present- day return levels of hourly precipitation extremes and, although to a lesser extent, their future  changes. If all ensemble members are impacted by the graupel code error in a similar way to this  single-member test there may be a systematic shift in the ensemble projected change of about  5-10% which could be important for some applications.  Daily precipitation extremes:  •   The impact of the graupel code error is less for daily precipitation extremes than hourly  precipitation extremes. For daily extremes, the graupel code error has a small, but locally  significant, impact on present-day return levels, but (in contrast to hourly extremes) does not  have a significant impact on future changes.  •   Present-day 2-year and 5-year return levels of daily precipitation extremes are reduced by about  5% on average across the UK on fixing the graupel code error (Fig 21).

How does fixing the graupel term affect extreme precipitation forecasts in the UKCP 2.2km model?,"['chunk: An error was found within the UKCP 2.2km climate model in the microphysics code that represents  graupel. Graupel is a second category of ice with higher densities and fall speeds found in convective  cloud (Forbes and Halliwell, 2003). It is included in the 2.2km convection-permitting model (CPM),  but not in the 12km regional model (where instead all ice precipitation is diagnosed uniquely as  snow, with no graupel category). The error was in the graupel auto-conversion term, which controls  the fraction of snow converted to graupel . In general, it has resulted in too much snow being  converted to graupel.  Graupel is used to calculate lightning using the McCaul et al. (2009) lightning prediction scheme, and  so this graupel error impacts the simulation of lightning. We note that lightning data was not issued  from the original UKCP Local 2.2km projections, due to concerns over its verification, likely related to  the graupel code error. Therefore, fixing the graupel code error creates the potential to now provide  lightning data as a user diagnostic.  Graupel is in the snowfall output diagnostics, but since the error was in the term that converts  between hydrometeor types rather than in the absolute amount of ice/snow, the impact on total  precipitation is smaller. Following operational practice at the time, graupel was ignored by the land  surface model JULES in the UKCP CPM, and so was not included in the snowpack (Kendon et al.,  2019). This setting was recommended due to the tendency for the convection-permitting model to  produce too much small graupel, which if included in the snowpack would lead to an overestimation  of lying snow. The consequence of this is that, since the graupel error in general meant more snow  was converted to graupel, its effect was to reduce the snowpack.  The error has been found to have been present between Unified Model (UM) versions 10.3 and 11.3  inclusive (operational between 2016 and 2020) and affects model runs where both of the following  criteria are true: (1) prognostic graupel is in use; and (2) a temporary logical switch  l_fix_mphys_diags_iter is switched on. Operational numerical weather prediction (NWP)  configurations are thus unaffected by the error since global atmosphere (GA) model configurations  do not use prognostic graupel, and regional atmosphere (RA) model configurations (including the UK  forecast model, UKV) have l_fix_mphys_diags_iter switched off. However, this temporary logical was  switched on in the UKCP 2.2km CPM to be consistent with the driving 12km regional climate model  (RCM) and 60km global climate model (GCM). This should have been a null change since the  l_fix_mphys_diags_iter temporary logical is only intended to affect models that use sub-stepping in  the microphysics scheme, which is not the  case in regional models such as the UKCP CPM.  Unfortunately, turning it on led to an erroneous section of the microphysics code being activated.   The error was detected following a detailed investigation of some simulations performed with the  same version of the model over the Colorado mountains. It was not found in the UKCP simulations  since much less precipitation falls as snow over the UK, and the impact on total precipitation is small.  In the Colorado simulations, it was found that there was nearly as much graupel as snow, which does  not agree with observations. As well as graupel amounts, the code error was found to impact  lightning flash rates, some land surface diagnostics and does change the evolution of the model,  albeit in a relatively minor way. These impacts over the Colorado mountains are expected to be  reduced over the UK, due to the comparatively lower snowfall amounts, but need to be quantified  and taken into account by users of UKCP 2.2km results.  We note that in addition to the graupel code error above, ongoing research is underway within the  Met Office on improving the representation of graupel within the operational UKV model (Field et', 'chunk: As above, the results here are based on using 19 years of data from a single ensemble member, and  so the estimation of return levels is subject to uncertainty.

"""How do UKCP18's projections, based on CMIP5, differ from UKCP09's in approach and resolution?""","['chunk: The UKCP18 land projections replace the previous UKCP09 scenarios, taking into account subsequent  feedback from users and developments in modelling capability. The new projections consist of three  Strands. Strand 1 provides updated probabilistic projections, which incorporate new information (notably  from the latest CMIP5 generation of international climate models). These are a direct replacement for the  probabilistic projections that formed the centrepiece of UKCP09. In addition, UKCP18 includes two new  products (Strands 2 and 3), consisting of time series of climate model output, without the extensive  statistical postprocessing required to produce Strand 1. These are provided in response to user requests for  flexible datasets consisting of a wider range of climate variables with full spatial and temporal coherence,  capable of supporting a range of impacts assessments. Strand 2 provides a new set of global model  projections including a 15-member perturbed parameter ensemble ( PPE) of the Hadley Centre global  model HadGEM3-GC3.05 (hereafter GC3.05-PPE) and a 13-member multi-model ensemble of CMIP5  models (hereafter CMIP5-13). GC3.05-PPE is higher resolution than the global simulations that formed the  core of UKCP09, in particular 60km grid spacing compared to 300km, as well as including several model  improvements. Strand 3 provides downscaled regional climate model (RCM) projections, with a 12-member  ensemble with a 12km grid spacing for Europe. The UKCP18 Land Projections Part 1 report (Murphy et al,  2018) describes and compares projections from Strands 1, 2 and 3. This Part 2 report presents results from  a 12-member ensemble with a 2.2km grid spacing for the UK, which form a second component of Strand 3.  These simulations are termed “convection-permitting” because convective storms are explicitly  represented on the model grid, providing new capability for advice on projected changes at very fine spatial  and temporal scales. This new 2.2km convect ion-permitting model (CPM) ensemble is compared with the  12km RCM, and guidance is provided on the interpretation and use of these projections in the context of  the other Strands of information from UKCP18. 1 1 Recap of UKCP09 and drivers for UKCP18 The UK Climate Projections UKCP09 (Jenkins et al, 2009) were the first set of UK scenarios developed to  support risk assessments, providing quantitative estimates of uncertainty in future climate change. In  addition to probabilistic projections, UKCP09 provided a set of regional projections using a 25km grid  spacing. These consisted of an 11-member perturbed parameter ensemble of RCM simulations for Europe,  supporting applications requiring detailed impacts information at local to sub-national scales. For example  the 25km projections were used in assessments of drought (Burke et al, 2010), river flows (Prudhomme et  al, 2012), water availability (Sanderson et al, 2012), flood frequency (Kay and Jones, 2012), and effects on  the electricity and rail networks (McColl et al, 2012; Palin et al, 2013). It was necessary to use the RCM  simulations if time-series of spatially consistent future projections were required, and UKCP09 users were  encouraged to use the RCM simulations in conjunction with the broader sampling of uncertainties  contained in the probabilistic projections. A weather generator (Jones et al, 2010) was also provided in UKCP09, which was driven by change factors  sampled from the projections. The weather generator provided time series information at the hourly and  5km scale, but only utilizing 25km scale climate change information. Thus any climate change processes  specific to local or hourly scales (for example greater increases in hourly precipitation extremes due to local  storm feedbacks, Lenderink and van Meijgaard, 2008) were not represented in the weather generator  output.

How do UKCP models show large-scale drivers' effects on UK weather patterns?,"['chunk: The UKCP Global models capture both the relative frequencies of the different patterns and their seasonal  variations. For example, WT 2, which is characterised by low pressure over the UK and typically brings  unsettled weather, occurs during a higher proportion of days in winter than in summer (Figure 2). However,  there can be strong interannual and interdecadal variability in the relative frequencies of these weather  patterns.

Source: Met Office © Crown Copyright 2020 www.metoffice.gov.uk Pg 3 of 6', 'chunk: The probabilistic, global and regional projections that comprise the UKCP18 land projections are derived  from climate models which approximate the real climate system. Hence there are systematic differences  between climate model results and observations (i.e. biases). In addition, climate models neglect unknown  effects of missing earth system processes. While the combined evidence of UKCP18 covers a broad range  of potential future climate pathways, it remains possible that observed future changes could lie outside the  envelope of these. Future generations of climate models will be developed that reflect improved scientific  capabilities and understanding, potentially leading to a requirement to update the UKCP18 projections  resulting in new, and potentially different, advice. The probabilistic projections  We have designed the probabilistic projections to provide the primary tool for assessments of the ranges of  uncertainties in UKCP18. For a given emissions scenario, they provide information on known uncertainties in  future climate changes. In particular, the aim is to represent uncertainties consistent with the knowledge  incorporated in existing ensembles of climate model projections, plus the effects of internal climate  variability. They are derived from a statistical framework that supports the formal application of  observational constraints and estimation of the relative likelihood of specific outcomes. However, we  emphasise that they are conditional on the knowledge, data, methods and subjective choices used to  construct them. As such, they should not be confused with (for example) probabilistic weather forecasts,  which can be assessed in a frequentist sense through repeated trial and verification (e.g. Hamill, 1997).  Other researchers could arrive at different results if  they made different choices. For a more detailed  discussion see Section 2.1 of the Land Projections Science Report, (Murphy et al, 2018). The probabilistic projections typically show broader ranges of outcomes than the global and regional  projections. This enables assessments across a larger set of climate futures than relying on a small set of  future outcomes, e.g. only using the climate models from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project  (CMIP5) that fed into the 5 th  Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  The probabilistic format should not be misinterpreted as an indication of high confidence in the weight of  evidence behind specific outcomes. That is, future developments in our physical understanding of climate  change drivers and improvements in climate modelling capability could lead in the future to revised  projections giving different probabilities for changes in UK variables. The probabilistic projections should be  seen as a source of broad guidance that forms a useful starting point for risk assessments.  The global, regional, local and derived projections The global, regional and local projections provide flexible datasets derived directly from climate model  output. These have full spatial and temporal coherence and offer information on a wider set of variables  (that are physically consistent), metrics and time scales than is available from the probabilistic projections.  These projections provide storylines of climate futures that you can use to develop case studies, stress-test  your system and decision options. You can also use the global and regional projections to build confidence in  your use of the data, by providing opportunities to explain the future outcomes that they represent. For  example, the global model provides information on large-scale drivers that affect the patterns of weather  that we experience in the UK. Drivers include the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, a large system  of ocean currents that carries warm water from the tropics northwards into the North Atlantic.

How does rising GMSL impact coastal wave energy and surf zone dynamics?,"['chunk: •  The primary effect of mean sea level increase on waves is to increase the mean height around which the  waves fluctuate, leading to increased over-topping and coastal flooding. An important secondary inshore  effect arises as follows. The maximum amplitude of waves before breaking in shallow water is limited by  the water depth (e.g. Goda, 2000). Thus, an increase in mean sea level will in general have the secondary  effect of moving the surf zone further inshore, increasing the wave energy available at the coast for  over-topping and coastal erosion, thereby exacerbating the primary effect. We do not assess this  secondary inshore effect here: our assessment of changes in the wave climate focuses on offshore wave  changes.  2� Introduction Section summary: Changes in global and regional sea level arise from a wide variety of geophysical  processes that operate on different time and space scales (the sea level “jigsaw puzzle”)� Global mean  sea level (GMSL) rise occurs from thermal expansion of seawater and the addition of water to the ocean  from the loss of land-based ice and water� Changes in land-based ice and water storage result in spatial  patterns of regional sea level change through the associated impact on Earth’s gravity field and other  effects� Local changes in seawater density and ocean circulation also give rise to a spatial pattern of  change, which varies markedly among climate models, and is therefore highly uncertain� In addition, the  ongoing response of the Earth system to the last deglaciation brings about a spatial pattern of regional  sea level change across the UK that is dominated by the effect of vertical land motion� At local scales,  the impacts of coastal sea level change typically arise prim arily from extreme water level events� These  deviations from the regional mean water level are often associated with storm surges and extreme wave  conditions combined with the local tide� The UKCP18 sea level work focuses on 21 st  century projections  of: (i) regional time-mean sea level; (ii) changes in surge extremes; (iii) potential changes in tide and  surge characteristics; and (iv) changes in local wave climate� In addition, we present exploratory  projections of regional time-mean sea level change out to 2300� All projections are rooted in, or  traceable to, CMIP5 climate model simulations under the RCP climate change scenarios�  2�1 The sea level “jigsaw puzzle” Changes in sea level occur due to a broad range of geophysical processes that operate on different spatial  scales and time scales. Like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, it is important to have an appreciation of how  these different processes combine, and in some cases interact, to see the whole picture.

"""What are the trade-offs between resource use and detail in different resolutions for climate models?""","['chunk: 2 1 Overview UKCP18 is the first time internationally that an ensemble of climate projections has been carried out at  convection-permitting scale for use in national climate scenarios. This therefore represents a step forward  in our ability to quantify uncertainties in future changes at local and hourly time scales. However, it also  represents a major cost in terms of computing resource. Before embarking on the final ensemble  simulations, work was therefore carried out to determine the optimal resolution, model configuration and  experimental design for the CPM ensemble. In particular, for a given computer resource, increasing model  resolution (within the convection-permitting regime) comes at the cost of shorter simulations, a smaller  domain or a smaller ensemble size. Thus the scientific benefits of increased resolution, within the  convection-permitting definition, were assessed and balanced against user needs. The CPM configuration is based on the Met Office operational UK-Variable resolution (UKV) model, which has  been extensively tested within NWP trials (Bush et al, 2019). Previous CPM climate simulations (Kendon et  al, 2014) were based on an older UKV configuration, and therefore it was important to test the recent model  configuration in climate length runs and confirm that improvements seen in NWP were realised on longer  timescales. We also tested other recent developments including the use of “Easy Aerosol”, in which time  series of aerosol properties and cloud droplet number concentration are prescribed (Stevens et al, 2017), in  order to replicate approximately the aerosol forcing simulated in the driving global model (cf. Section 2.4). The CPM and chosen experimental design are outlined in the following sub-sections, along with a brief  summary of evidence supporting the choice (further details can be found in Fosser et al, submitted). Key  considerations were scientific credibility, utility for stakeholders and computational performance. 2 2 Choice of convection-permitting resolution Before embarking on the final CPM (“production”) ensemble, test simulations were performed to determine  the optimal CPM resolution (Fosser et al, submitted). In particular three different convection permitting  resolutions (4km, 2.2km and 1.5km) were assessed in terms of their representation of precipitation,  weighed against the additional computational cost of higher resolution (2.2km is 5.5 times and 1.5km 14  times more expensive than 4km). The test simulations span the UK, for a 12 year period (March 1996 to June 2008, with three months  discarded as spin-up) and were driven by the recent European Centre for Medium-Range Weather  Forecasts Re-Analysis, ERA-Interim (Dee et al, 2011). The latter allows assessment of the CPM  performance when provided with a quasi-observational time series of the atmospheric circulation at its  lateral boundaries, largely free of the biases typically present in global climate models (GCMs). The test  simulations were done with Met Office Unified Model version 10.1 (UM10.1), using the version of the NWP  UKV model that was operational in 2015 (for more details see Fosser et al, submitted). The CPMs were also  assessed against a 12km RCM. The latter is a limited-area version of the Global Atmosphere GA7  configuration of the Met Office Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model HadGEM3 (Walters et al, 2019),  similar to the GA7.05 configuration used for the Strand 2 and 3 projections (see Secti on 2.4). This  comparison provided an opportunity to compare CPM performance against a regional model that includes  convective parameterisation, and is typical of RCMs used previously to provide downscaling information in  national climate scenarios.

These local values can be averaged over the UK to  give a range of seasonal average precipitation changes between the 10% and 90% probability levels.

"What improvements do the Updated Local 2.2km projections show in snowfall and snow cover, and how do they differ in spatial and temporal variability across the UK compared to the original?","['chunk: •  Widespread and substantial snow events have occurred in 2018, 2013, 2010 and 2009, but their  number and severity have generally declined since the 1960s. •  For the period 2061-2080, under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), the Regional (12km) and Local   (2.2km) projections show a decrease in both falling and lying snow across the UK relative to the   1981-2000 baseline. In general, the decreases in percentage terms are smaller in both falling and lying  snow in mountainous regions (e.g. Scottish Highlands) than in low-lying regions (e.g. southern England). •  There are differences in estimates of future snow between the Regional (12km) and Local  (2.2km)  projections. Decreases in both falling and lying snow (over Scottish mountains) are larger in the regional  projections compared to the local projections. We have greater confidence in the new Local (2.2km)  projections compared to the Regional projections, since differences can be linked to the improved  representation of wintertime convective showers and topography in the 2.2km model. •  The Updated Local 2.2km projections (released July 2021) have a much improved representation of  snowfall and lying snow at the surface compared to the original Local 2.2km projections (released  September 2019).

The differences between the RCM and CPM are mainly due to the differences in the way the models simulate  snowfall and the improved representation of topography in the CPM (see Kendon et al, 2019a, Section 3.5  for further details). In the updated Local 2.2km projections (released July 2021), there is a much improved  representation of snowfall and lying snow at the surface compared to the original Local 2.2km projections  (released September 2019). In general this leads to greater consistency between the CPM and RCM. The updated Local (2.2km) model produces more snowfall over the Scottish mountains and less in the  vicinity of the northwest coastline of Scotland compared to the RCM. There is also more lying snow over high  ground in Scotland in the CPM. These differences are likely explained by the higher resolution of the CPM  leading to a better representation of mountains, and the ability of the CPM to better represent the  movement of convective showers inland. Therefore, the Local (2.2km) projections provide the best  information available on snow in the UKCP suite of products, due to the better representation of topography  and wintertime convective showers. What do you need to be aware of? This factsheet details the biases in the data, though direct comparison with observations is difficult. Users  should be aware that both the Regional (12km) and Local (2.2km) projections underestimate uncertainties,  as they only downscale versions of the Met Office Hadley Centre model. Although the local projections can provide information on small-scale weather events in the future, they  should not be confused with an operational weather forecast, which provides information on weather that is  likely to be experienced in the next few days. Instead the local projections provide a set of plausible projections  of climate change for the UK, if we follow a high emission scenario (i.e. RCP8.5). In particular, they provide  information on the local effects of changes in the types of weather that may be experienced in the future.  The local projections sample a narrower range of potential future outcomes than the full set of global  projections. In particular, the regional climate models only downscale 12 members of the PPE-15 (and are in  turn downscaled using the CPM) and none of the CMIP5-13.

"How does vertical land movement affect UK sea level rise projections, including long-term trends and storm surges?","['chunk: The pattern of sea level rise is not uniform across the UK. Sea level rise is less in the north and more in the south,  this is mainly due to the movement of land, up and down.    We can continue to expect  increases to extreme coastal water levels driven mainly by increases in mean sea level  rise, although w  e cannot rule out additional changes in storm surges.    UKCP18 includes exploratory estimates of sea level rise out to 2300, which show continued rise beyond 2100. Sea  level rise is a long  -term challenge that initial results suggest varies substantially depending on how successful we are at curbing  global greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years.    10', 'chunk: •  The risk of coastal flood events will rise with the projections of increase in time-mean sea level. However,  based on storm surge modelling work, we suggest a best estimate of no significant additional increase in  the statistics of extreme water levels associated with atmospheric storminess change. The largest trend  found in our set of surge simulations of this additional component corresponds to a change of  approximately 10 cm per century for the 1-year return level, which is considerably less than the time- mean sea level change under the same emission scenario. However, we cannot rule out larger trends in  storm surge due to this additional component. The additional component could be either positive  (augmenting the mean sea level change) or negative (partially offsetting the mean sea level change).  •  21 st  century projections of average wave height suggest changes of the order 10-20% and a general  tendency towards lower wave heights. Changes in extreme waves are also of order 10-20%, but there is  little agreement in the sign of change among the model projections. High resolution wave simulations  suggest that the changes in wave climate over the 21 st  century on exposed coasts will be dominated by  the large-scale response to climate change. However, more sheltered coastal regions are likely to remain  dominated by local weather variability.  •  Exploratory, time-mean sea level projections to 2300 suggest that UK sea levels will continue to rise  over the coming centuries under all emission scenarios considered. For London the projection ranges at  2300 are approximately 0.5 - 2.2m and 1.4 - 4.3m for the lowest and highest emission scenarios,  respectively. The values for Edinburgh and Belfast are lower. The projections extending beyond 2100  should be considered as illustrative of the potential future changes.

"""What complexities arise with linear interpolation in WRMPs due to climate response non-linearity and projection uncertainties?""","['chunk: A particular challenge for WRMP 2014 and WRMP 2019 has been  developing a time series of climate change impacts through the  planning horizon to plan the timing of adaptation measures. This  includes accounting for climate change impacts which may already  have occurred. This is particularly important for sensitive systems  and when considering extended planning horizons a long way into  the future. Simple linear interpolation has been used to-date in the  industry, although it is recognised that both the climate change signal  and a system’s response to climate change are both non-linear. This  is no longer an issue in UKCP18, as it will enable users to define their  own reference baselines (both duration and timing) and specific future  time-horizons.', 'chunk: Additional caveats and limitations come with:  •  Derived projections. •  Extended exploratory time-mean sea level projections.  •  Tide and surge simulations. The derived projections over UK land areas use approximate methods to produce an estimate of RCP2.6  and global warming levels of 2 and 4 ° C (compared to pre-industrial). This introduces additional  uncertainties. One of the major assumptions is that we can use the climate model time series that reach  particular warming levels through the 21 st  century (transient) to inform a future that has reached a steady  warming level (stabilized). There is some evidence that future climate outcomes at a particular global  warming level can differ depending on whether that warming level is transient or stabilized (e.g. Ceppi et al,  2018). See UKCP18 Derived Scenarios Report (Gohar et al, 2018).  The extended exploratory time-mean sea level projections have much lower confidence than the 21 st   Century Projections. Consider these projections as sensitivity studies and do not interpret them as showing  the full range of post-2100 behaviour, or the most likely behaviour. The potential for additional sea level rise  from Antarctic dynamic ice discharge is even more uncertain on these time horizons, with some studies  suggesting several additional metres of rise by 2300 under RCP8.5.  The simulations of changes in tide and surge characteristics make the simple assumption of a fixed  coastline under all levels of future sea level rise.  10.  Take care when comparing/combining variables When carrying out analyses that consider more than one variable, ensure that any outcomes are consistent  and coherent in their representation of the changes. For the probabilistic projections, there is no spatial  coherence. For the global, regional, local and derived projections ensure that you choose variables from the  same member of the set of projections. For example, summer temperature from one member is unlikely to  be consistent with precipitation from another. Choosing a model based on being amongst the largest of the probabilistic climate changes in summer  does not necessarily translate into the same model being in such an extreme position in the winter  change results.

What underlies UKCP's probabilistic climate forecasts?,"['chunk: a.   UKCP-Probabilistic  The probabilistic projections in UKCP18 were based on 348 perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE)  simulations derived from a single climate model (HadCM3), augmented by twelve earth system model  projections from the CMIP5 archive (Taylor et al., 2012). These add uncertainties arising from alternative  choices in model structure to the parametric uncertainties represented by the PPE simulations. A  Bayesian framework (Sexton et al., 2012; Harris et al., 2013; Sexton and Harris, 2015) is used to combine  this information with a set of observational constraints, using emulation techniques to construct  probability distribution functions (pdfs) that express broad ranges of possible outcomes for climate  variability and change during the 21 st  century. The updated methodology for UKCP18 is described in  more detail by Murphy et al. (2018).   The probabilistic projections are presented in an “emissions-driven” format, representing the  combined effects of uncertainties in physical and carbon cycle feedbacks in response to a prescribed  pathway of future greenhouse gas emissions. They are available for five such pathways: The SRES A1B  scenario (Nakicenovic and Swart, 2000) plus the RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 scenarios (Moss et al., 2010). In  this report, we consider results from RCP2.6 and 8.5 (see section 2d).  In section 4b we compare 5 th -95 th  percentile ranges from UKCP-Probabilistic against the full ranges  available from CMIP6 and other UKCP components. This presentation of the pdfs is chosen because we  expect extreme outcomes in the tails of the distributions to be more sensitive to limitations in the  statistical assumptions required in the methodology (UKCP18 Technical Note, 2019). Nevertheless, the  occurrence of simulated outcomes in other products outside the 5-95% ranges of UKCP-Probabilistic  does not necessarily indicate inconsistency with the latter, since we expect a 10% probability of seeing  such outcomes.        b.

The UKCP18 shelf seas model is used  to provide a spatially continuous estimate of coastal sea level variability around the UK and aid the  interpretation of the available tide gauge records. Further details on the model configuration and  experimental design are available in section A1.7.  An indicative set of UK tide gauge records and corresponding shelf seas model simulated time series is  presented in Figure A2.5.1. Tide gauges are selected on the basis of geographical coverage and the series  length. All time series are linearly detrended in order to focus on sea level variability, rather than secular  change signals. The shelf seas model simulation generally does a good job of reproducing the magnitude  and temporal characteristics (see Tinker et al, in prep) of the UK tide gauges, and accounts for between  about 60% and 100% of the observed variability (Figure A2.5.1).  Across the larger European domain, the shelf seas model does a good job of capturing the spatial variations  in the magnitude of observed sea level variability, with a spatial correlation of 0.7 based on the selected tide  gauge records (Figure A2.5.2). The model generally underestimates the observed variability, by an average  of about 1 cm.

How does adjusting the graupel auto-conversion in the UKCP 2.2km model affect lightning and snowpack representation?,"['chunk: An error was found within the UKCP 2.2km climate model in the microphysics code that represents  graupel. Graupel is a second category of ice with higher densities and fall speeds found in convective  cloud (Forbes and Halliwell, 2003). It is included in the 2.2km convection-permitting model (CPM),  but not in the 12km regional model (where instead all ice precipitation is diagnosed uniquely as  snow, with no graupel category). The error was in the graupel auto-conversion term, which controls  the fraction of snow converted to graupel . In general, it has resulted in too much snow being  converted to graupel.  Graupel is used to calculate lightning using the McCaul et al. (2009) lightning prediction scheme, and  so this graupel error impacts the simulation of lightning. We note that lightning data was not issued  from the original UKCP Local 2.2km projections, due to concerns over its verification, likely related to  the graupel code error. Therefore, fixing the graupel code error creates the potential to now provide  lightning data as a user diagnostic.  Graupel is in the snowfall output diagnostics, but since the error was in the term that converts  between hydrometeor types rather than in the absolute amount of ice/snow, the impact on total  precipitation is smaller. Following operational practice at the time, graupel was ignored by the land  surface model JULES in the UKCP CPM, and so was not included in the snowpack (Kendon et al.,  2019). This setting was recommended due to the tendency for the convection-permitting model to  produce too much small graupel, which if included in the snowpack would lead to an overestimation  of lying snow. The consequence of this is that, since the graupel error in general meant more snow  was converted to graupel, its effect was to reduce the snowpack.  The error has been found to have been present between Unified Model (UM) versions 10.3 and 11.3  inclusive (operational between 2016 and 2020) and affects model runs where both of the following  criteria are true: (1) prognostic graupel is in use; and (2) a temporary logical switch  l_fix_mphys_diags_iter is switched on. Operational numerical weather prediction (NWP)  configurations are thus unaffected by the error since global atmosphere (GA) model configurations  do not use prognostic graupel, and regional atmosphere (RA) model configurations (including the UK  forecast model, UKV) have l_fix_mphys_diags_iter switched off. However, this temporary logical was  switched on in the UKCP 2.2km CPM to be consistent with the driving 12km regional climate model  (RCM) and 60km global climate model (GCM). This should have been a null change since the  l_fix_mphys_diags_iter temporary logical is only intended to affect models that use sub-stepping in  the microphysics scheme, which is not the  case in regional models such as the UKCP CPM.  Unfortunately, turning it on led to an erroneous section of the microphysics code being activated.   The error was detected following a detailed investigation of some simulations performed with the  same version of the model over the Colorado mountains. It was not found in the UKCP simulations  since much less precipitation falls as snow over the UK, and the impact on total precipitation is small.  In the Colorado simulations, it was found that there was nearly as much graupel as snow, which does  not agree with observations. As well as graupel amounts, the code error was found to impact  lightning flash rates, some land surface diagnostics and does change the evolution of the model,  albeit in a relatively minor way. These impacts over the Colorado mountains are expected to be  reduced over the UK, due to the comparatively lower snowfall amounts, but need to be quantified  and taken into account by users of UKCP 2.2km results.  We note that in addition to the graupel code error above, ongoing research is underway within the  Met Office on improving the representation of graupel within the operational UKV model (Field et\nheading: Part 2: Technical description of graupel code error |ukcp_graupel_technical_note.pdf\nfile_name: ukcp_graupel_technical_note.pdf\nsection_id: 616\nfile_id: 61', 'chunk: graupel code error, the simulation of lightning is considerably improved, allowing it to be potentially  provided as a user diagnostic in the new release; representing an enhancement for users.   The existing UKCP Local 2.2km data can be used for developing methods for application of the 2.2km  data and for many applications, although extra care should be taken for applications using variables  identified above as being affected by the graupel code error. This note will help users better  understand when it is appropriate to use the UKCP 2.2km data in its current form. New data from the  UKCP Local 2.2km model with the graupel code error fixed will be issued, with a planned release date  of Spring 2021, and once available this should become the preferred dataset for all applications. Whilst  many applications are unlikely to be strongly impacted by using the new data, we believe that issuing  new data will provide the widest access to all UKCP products (i.e. ensuring the same quality of data  for all locations and for all types of adaptation decision, consistent with our policy followed in earlier  generations of climate projections). The new data will also come with the benefi t of potentially  providing additional climate metrics that are not available at present. We reiterate that the UKCP  probabilistic, global and regional projections are unaffected by this issue, with no change to their use  guidance. Furthermore, we continue to recommend that UKCP products are used together, rather  than in isolation, in order to give the most complete picture of future climate.   Part 1: Advice on use of UKCP Local data  The UKCP Local 2.2km projections consist of an ensemble of 12 simulations at 2.2km resolution run  for 3 time periods (Kendon et al., 2019). The UKCP Local (2.2km) projections sit alongside a number  of other UKCP18 tools to look at climate change (Murphy et al., 2018, Lowe et al., 2018). These  include probabilistic projections, a set of 28 global 60km climate simulations and a set of twelve  regional 12km simulations. The UKCP Local (2.2km) projections are intended to be useful for impacts  assessments that require enhanced spatial detail or information on changes in extreme weather at  local and hourly timescales. However, they only downscale versions of the Hadley Centre climate  model and the RCP8.5 scenario, and so sample a narrower uncertainty range than the global or  probabilistic projections. It is important that users are aware of the other UKCP products and the  advantages of each for their application, and also that users consider the sensitivity of their  applications to  uncertainty in the UKCP outputs. Further guidance on which UKCP product to choose  is available from Fung et al. (2018a). The following advice is for those who have already used or are  planning to use UKCP Local (2.2km) data, and covers the use of precipitation, temperature, snow,  wind and lightning outputs.   The results reported in this technical note (see Part 2) show that fixing the graupel code error in the  single-member test leads to some differences that exceed the standard deviation across the 12- member UKCP 2.2km ensemble. Under the assumption that the other 11 ensemble members are  impacted similarly (although differences could be larger or smaller in other members that have the  same model physics but sample different large-scale conditions), we judge the impact of the graupel  code error to be significant compared to the ensemble spread, for some variables in some seasons,  and especially in some locations. Although the current UKCP Local (2.2km) data remains suitable for  many users dependent on application, to promote the widest access to all UKCP products in all  regions of the UK, the decision has been taken to rerun the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections with the  graupel code error fixed. These new data should be the preferred source for all new users. For  current users of t he existing UKCP 2.2km data, in many cases it is not necessary to rerun analysis  with the new data, except for specific variables and seasons (as outlined below).\nheading: graupel code error, the simulation of lightning is considerably improved, allowing it to be potentially |ukcp_graupel_technical_note.pdf\nfile_name: ukcp_graupel_technical_note.pdf\nsection_id: 594\nfile_id: 61']","Adjusting the graupel auto-conversion term in the UKCP 2.2km model affects the representation of lightning and snowpack by causing more snow to be converted to graupel, which impacts the simulation of lightning and reduces the snowpack.",multi_context,True,gpt-4-turbo,sections,,,,,
What are the RCP values in AR5 and their impact on Strand 1 projections?,"['chunk: In Strand 1, projections are provided for each of the RCP scenarios (Moss et al., 2010) assessed in AR5 (2.6,  4.5, 6.0 and 8.5), and also the SRES A1B scenario (Nakicenovic and Swart, 2000). The latter allows a direct  comparison with UKCP09. As noted above, these represent “emissions-driven” projections that describe  uncertainties in the conversion of carbon emissions to CO 2  concentrations in the atmosphere, as well as  uncertainty in the physical climate system response to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. For each  emissions scenario, the probabilistic projections from Strand 1 therefore account for a range of future CO 2   concentration pathways. The Strand 2 and 3 simulations were run only for RCP8.5, due to restrictions in high performance computing  (HPC) capacity. As GC3.05 does not include a carbon cycle component, the GC3.05-PPE members were  run with prescribed CO 2  concentrations. However, different concentration pathways were used for each  member, chosen to replicate approximately the range of outcomes projected in Strand 1. In this way, the  GC3.05-PPE simulations reflect the global effects of carbon cycle uncertainties on projected changes,  though carbon cycle effects on  regional patterns  of change are omitted, in contrast to Strand 1. The CMIP5  simulations added to Strand 2 are also based on physical climate system models lacking an interactive  carbon cycle. In this sense they are consistent with GC3.05-PPE, however the relevant RCP8.5 experiment  was a concentration-driven experiment in which all CMIP5 models used the same CO 2  pathway. The spread  of outcomes in the combined set of Strand 2 projections the refore contains contributions from internal  variability, uncertainties in modelling of physical processes and aerosol chemistry (from both the GC3.05- PPE and CMIP5 simulations), and from uncertainty in the globally-averaged effects of carbon cycle  feedbacks (from GC3.05-PPE only). In Strand 3, each RCM-PPE member inherits the CO 2  pathway prescribed in its driving Strand 2 global  simulation. This is also the case for changes in the forcing due to anthropogenic aerosols, which are  prescribed from the driving model using a technique described in section 4.2.

"""How does the Atlantic Jet Stream impact UK winter weather?""","['chunk: The Atlantic Jet Stream (or the ‘eddy-driven jet’) is a core of strong winds around 5 to 7 miles above the  Earth’s surface, blowing from west to east. Shifting jet stream patterns can have a big impact on UK weather,  particularly by determining the position of the North Atlantic Storm track in winter. For example, read about  the influence of the jet stream on the unusually wet October 2019 ( https://blog.metoffice.gov. uk/2019/11/04/the-jet-stream-casts-its-shadow-over-the-uk-duringoctober/ ). The winter jet stream over the North Atlantic has 3 ‘preferred’ positions – at around 35-38°N, 45-47°N and  58-60°N  Woollings et al. (2010) . The position determines the path that weather systems and storms take  across the Atlantic. This tri-modal pattern, and the long-term average frequency at which the jet takes each  of the three positions, is reasonably well captured by the UKCP Global models 1  (Figure 1). Figure 2 illustrates the differences in rainfall patterns associated with a strong jet in each of the three  positions - when a strong jet is in the ‘North’ position (50-60°N) it brings wetter-than-average conditions to  the northern Europe (Scotland and Scandinavia); conversely in the ‘South’ position (30-40°N) it is Southern  Europe (Spain and Mediterranean Europe) that receive greater than average rainfall. The UK experiences  greater-than-average rainfall when a strong jet is in its ‘Mid’ position (40-50°N). It’s important to note that there is large year-to-year natural variability in the number of days when the jet is  in each of these three positions, which is one reason why some years are wetter and/or stormier than others  in the UK.

The frequency distribution is  a smoothed representation of the number of days that the jet sits within a given latitude interval during the period 1981-2000. 1  We’ve compared the climate model results with a historical quasi-observed dataset, ERA-Interim. These quasi-observed datasets are produced by  combining meteorological observations and a climate model to give a more complete picture of the climate during an observed period. Re-analysis  datasets are particularly useful for evaluating how well a climate model simulates aspects of the atmosphere that are difficult to observe directly.

The strength of the pressure gradient between the region of low near  Iceland (the ‘Icelandic low’) and the region of high pressure near the Azores (the ‘Azores high’) influences both  the strength and position of the Atlantic storm track. When the pressure difference is large, the NAO is  described as positive and the westerly winds are strong and storms tend to be stronger, more frequent and  travel across north-western Europe. When the pressure difference is small, storms tend to travel across  southern Europe. Although the NAO occurs throughout the year, it is particularly dominant during the winter. The NAO is known to be strongly associated with some historical winter flooding and wind events. By using  its relationship to UK and European precipitation, UKCP Global could potentially be used to understand the  NAO’s influence on projected increases in winter precipitation, alongside other drivers such as increases in  atmospheric moisture content.

"What are the suggested changes for handling UKCP Local 2.2km data, especially for snow and winter temp variables, post-graupel error detection?","['chunk: 9 th  September 2020  Elizabeth Kendon, Steven Chan, Hayley Fowler, Fai Fung, Jason Lowe, James Murphy, Cath Senior,  Christopher Short, Simon Tucker and Jonathan Wilkinson    Headlines  •   We have found an error within the UKCP Local 2.2km climate model in the computer code  that determines how much of the solid precipitation falls as snow and how much as small ice  pellets.   •   No other UKCP product is affected by the error, and top-level messages from UKCP in terms  of climate change in the UK are unchanged.  •   The existing 2.2km data can still be used for many applications, but extra care is needed in  the use of data for some variables and locations. The variables primarily affected are snow  and winter temperature especially over Scotland, for which the existing 2.2km data should  not be used. Also affected but to a lesser extent are winter precipitation, hourly  precipitation extremes across the UK and wind extremes over the ocean and north-west  coastal regions, and for these variables the existing 2.2km data should be used with caution.  The variables unaffected are summer temperature including extremes and summer mean  precipitation.   •   New data with the error fixed will be issued, with a planned release for Spring 2021.  •   On fixing the error, the simulation of lightning is considerably improved, allowing it to be  potentially provided as a user diagnostic in the new release in 2021.  •   This report is aimed at more technical users of the 2.2km data, providing guidance on when  applications are likely unaffected by the error or where users should wait for the new 2.2km  data.   Summary  An error has been found within the UKCP 2.2km climate model in the scheme that represents graupel,  which are soft small ice pellets with higher densities and fall speeds than snow. Graupel is typically  smaller than hail and forms when supercooled water coats a snowflake. Subsequent testing has shown  that the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections (including for temperature, precipitation and wind) can still  provide important information for many applications related to climate change but there is a need to  update the user guidance on use of the UKCP 2.2km data, with additional caveats. Over the coming  months, we will provide new additional simulations from the UKCP 2.2km climate model with the error  fixed, which should ultimately be treated as the preferred dataset.    The graupel error emerged whilst having a detailed look at simulations performed with the same  version of the model over the Colorado mountains. The error was in the code that controls the  fraction of snow converted to graupel, rather than in the total snow/ice amount, and in general  resulted in too much snow being converted to graupel. In the operational weather forecast model,  graupel is included but the section of erroneous code is turned off, and thus operational weather  forecasts are not impacted. No other UKCP product is affected by the error, and top-level messages  from UKCP in terms of climate change in the UK (Lowe et al 2018) are not impacted.

The only difference in the GMSL projections used in UKCP18 is that we update  the estimate of the sea level contribution from Antarctic ice dynamics following the work of Levermann et  al, (2014). In this section we present a brief synopsis of the AR5 methods and provide a comparison with  the UKCP18 GMSL projections for the 21 st  century. We refer the reader to Church et al, (2013) and the  associated supplementary materials (available at  http://www.climatechange2013.org/report/full-report/ )  for a more complete discussion.  The GMSL projections presented in AR5 (Church et al, 2013) include estimates of the contribution from: (i)  ocean thermal expansion; (ii) mass changes in the Greenland Ice Sheet; (iii) mass changes in the Antarctic  Ice Sheet; (iv) mass changes in other ice caps and glaciers; (v) changes in sea level related to projections of  groundwater extraction and reservoir impoundment. The ice sheet terms are further broken down into a  contribution from surface mass balance and a contribution from ice dynamics, resulting in a total of seven  individual components of GMSL change. There were three major advances in the sea level science reported  in AR5 compared to the previous IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4, Bindoff et al, 2007). The first was  the demonstration of closure of the GMSL budget, i.e. the summation of observation-based estimates of  terms (i) - (v) was consistent with an independent estimate of GMSL change based on a tide-gauge  reconstruction for the period 1971-2008 (Church et  al, 2011). The second was the demonstration of better  agreement between process-based model estimates of GMSL change and observations.

How do SMPs use future mapping and climate projections for coastal development and erosion management?,"['chunk: Local authorities normally take the lead in managing coastal  erosion risk, under the overview of the Environment Agency  (EA). The processes of this management range from local  projects through broader strategic studies to regional Shoreline  Management Plans (SMP) and national assessments. It is normal  for such studies to include mapping of future shore position across  diﬀerent epochs extending 100 years into the future; occasionally  this timeframe is much longer. Planning authorities will typically  refer to SMP mapping to decide whether a new coastal  development is allowable.', 'chunk: •  More work is needed to improve our understanding of the current and future risks of coastal flood events  associated with drivers of extreme coastal water levels, particularly storm surges and waves. This  includes elucidating the relationships between atmospheric storminess and extreme storm surge events  around the UK. The development of storyline approaches is a useful framework in this context and could  be used, for example, to explore the spread in changes in storminess over the UK and the associated  changes in future flood risk. We note that there is currently very active discussion on different types of  storyline approach among the research and stakeholder communities. •  Given the limitations of climate models to represent shelf sea processes, ocean dynamical downscaling  should be explored to extract more reliable information on the emergent patterns of oceanographic sea  level change. Downscaled simulations are also potentially a way to include realistic expressions of sea  level variability with the emergent climate change signals, which may offer increased utility to coastal  stakeholders.  •  If there is demand for more detailed information on sea level change beyond the 21 st  century, it would be  useful to generate extended time-horizon model projections using several different modelling  approaches that include suitably sophisticated process representation (such as the two-layer model  used in UKCP18). These simplified climate models are well suited to exploring a wide range of climate  scenarios and this may also constitute a useful avenue of future research.

"How does fixing the graupel code error affect return levels of extreme precipitation, given ensemble variability?","['chunk: al., 2019). There is a tendency for too much small graupel and too little graupel with sizes greater  than 2mm, and, as a consequence, unlike in observations we rarely see graupel at the surface in the  summer or when the surface temperature is approximately 5ᵒC or more in current models. The  UKCP 2.2km CPM is similarly affected by this issue, which acts to lessen the effect of the graupel  code error (discussed above), since it means that the excessive graupel aloft is expected to have  little impact on surface parameters in the summer season (except for lightning activity which is  strongly dependent on graupel).   Results from testing fix to graupel code  The current UKCP 2.2km product consists of an ensemble of 12 simulations run for 3 time periods. In  order to assess the impact of the graupel code error in the UKCP Local (2.2km) projections, tests  have been rapidly performed for one ensemble member (specifically the UKCP 2.2km standard  reference member) where the graupel code error has been eliminated. The standard reference  member is specifically the member where no parameter perturbations were applied to the driving  model (Kendon et al., 2019). Here we present results looking at the impact of the graupel code error  on the present-day biases and projected changes in surface temperature, precipitation, wind and  lightning. 19 years of data are available from the test simulations to date and are reported here, and  we also provide information on the convergence of results from adding more years of data. We also  assess the significance of the impact of the graupel code error by comparing the difference between  the fixed and erro neous runs against the standard deviation across the original UKCP 2.2km 12- member ensemble for each variable. Because all ensemble members are expected to be impacted  similarly to the single-member test, we note that differences smaller than the CPM ensemble  standard deviation could still lead to a systematic shift in the ensemble-mean projection. Here, we  only have results from the single-member test, and use the original CPM ensemble standard  deviation as a benchmark of whether the impact of the graupel code error is greater than  differences we would expect between members. Where the impact of the graupel code error is less  than the standard deviation, i.e. the fixed-code test simulation is within the original ensemble  spread, we judge the impact of the graupel code error to not be significant.  The modified test suite is identical to the UKCP 2.2km CPM (described in Kendon et al., 2019), except  the short-term logical l_fix_mphys_diags_iter is switched from true to false. In this way, we avoid  activating the erroneous auto-conversion calculation, but do not actually fix the code itself (which  has been done for later UM versions) although the effect is the same.  Simulations were set off for  time-slice 1 (1980-2000) and for time-slice 3 (2060-2080) and the results here are reported using the  19 years of data available to date (after the first year of the simulations are discarded as spin-up).  Results here compare present-day performance and future changes for the test CPM with the  graupel code error fixed (CPM_fix) with the original UKCP CPM (CPM_UKCP) and the UKCP RCM, for  all data regridded to a common 12km grid. The same years of data are used from all model runs for a  fair comparison.   A summary of the impact of the graupel code error on future changes for key surface temperature  and precipitation metrics is provided in Table 2.', 'chunk: As above, the results here are based on using 19 years of data from a single ensemble member, and  so the estimation of return levels is subject to uncertainty. Therefore, we focus on relatively modest  extremes, specifically the 2-year and 5-year return levels of hourly and daily precipitation. In order  to assess whether the impact of the graupel code error is significant, we compare differences on  fixing the graupel with the spread across the original 12-member CPM ensemble. The key results are  as follows:  Hourly precipitation extremes:  •   The graupel code error has a significant impact on present-day return levels of hourly  precipitation extremes, even in summer, and a smaller but significant impact on future changes.  •   Present-day 2-year and 5-year return levels are reduced by about 20% on average across the UK  on fixing the graupel code error. This is the case on using data from all seasons and on using data  just from summer (which for hourly extremes largely dominates the all-year result, Figs 17 & 18).  The magnitude of the differences on fixing the graupel code error are larger than the original  UKCP CPM ensemble spread across almost all of the UK (for the 5-year return level the UK- average difference on fixing the graupel is 3.3 mm/h compared to an ensemble standard  deviation of 1.6 mm/h, Fig 17).  •   Future increases in 2-year and 5-year return levels are slightly greater (29% increase becomes  36% increase for 5-year return level) on fixing the error (Fig 19). In the case of the 5-year return  level, these differences are of a similar magnitude to the original UKCP ensemble spread in  future changes (Fig 19). Similar results are seen for summer (Fig 20): in this case the ensemble  spread is larger, but the impact of fixing the error can still exceed the ensemble standard  deviation locally.  •   Preliminary results looking at the 10-year return level of hourly precipitation extremes (not  shown) suggest that the impact of the graupel code error on the 10-year return level is very  similar to that for the 5-year return level with about a 20-25% reduction in the present-day  value, an increase in the future change (from 28% to 36%), and the difference in uplifts of a  similar magnitude to the ensemble standard deviation. With only 19-years of data from a single  ensemble member, it is not possible to investigate the impact of the graupel code error on  longer return period events.  •   The above results indicate that there is a significant impact of the graupel code error on present- day return levels of hourly precipitation extremes and, although to a lesser extent, their future  changes. If all ensemble members are impacted by the graupel code error in a similar way to this  single-member test there may be a systematic shift in the ensemble projected change of about  5-10% which could be important for some applications.  Daily precipitation extremes:  •   The impact of the graupel code error is less for daily precipitation extremes than hourly  precipitation extremes. For daily extremes, the graupel code error has a small, but locally  significant, impact on present-day return levels, but (in contrast to hourly extremes) does not  have a significant impact on future changes.  •   Present-day 2-year and 5-year return levels of daily precipitation extremes are reduced by about  5% on average across the UK on fixing the graupel code error (Fig 21). These differences are  larger than the original UKCP CPM ensemble spread over western areas, and so are significant  locally.']","Fixing the graupel code error significantly impacts return levels of extreme precipitation. For hourly precipitation extremes, present-day 2-year and 5-year return levels are reduced by about 20% on average across the UK, and future increases in these return levels are slightly greater. For daily precipitation extremes, the impact is smaller, reducing present-day 2-year and 5-year return levels by about 5% on average across the UK.

"""What are the projected % changes in Tmax and Tmin at 25km scale, and how do they compare to wider regional and global projections in uncertainty?""","['chunk: •  For Tmax and Tmin some studies using the 25km-scale data may be affected. The differences between  the new and original projections are qualitatively similar to those described above for aggregated- regions, noting that the average changes in spread (17% for Tmax and 16% for Tmin) are somewhat  larger compared to their aggregated-region counterparts.  •  It is likely that some applications using the 25km precipitation data will be significantly affected by the  differences, particularly in cases where the low- and/or high-end changes play a key role in  determination of impacts, decisions and risks. This is because the average difference in spread amounts  to 27%, with increases occurring at most locations. For example, in winter the average P90 response  increases from 40.5% to 46.6% in the new projections, though the difference varies substantially with  spatial location. •  Applications using the 25km results for sea-level pressure, total cloud cover and surface radiation  variables are also likely to be affected by the changes. This is due mainly to increased spread in the new  projections, amounting to 20% or more (considerably larger than for the corresponding aggregated- region results).  •  For sea-level pressure the average change in median response is 13%, suggesting that shifts in the pdfs  may also contribute to the impacts.

"""How was drought risk assessed in the Yorkshire Water study using a simple hydrological index and UKCP18 data?""","['chunk: Both case studies developed a set of actions for organisations to take,  some to do soon after UKCP18 release and others that would require  longer-term co-ordination and investment. More specifically, each  case study looked in detail (examples below) at how UKCP18 could be  used to reproduce existing assessments of flood and drought, enabling  a quick comparison with previous results.  Case Study 1:  JBA developed the methodology behind the EA’s  Flood Map for Surface Water (FMfSW); a key reference for Local  Authorities when conducting surface flooding preparedness and  response planning.

In the IPCC’s 5 th  Assessment, ECS was judged to have a “likely” range of  1.5-4.5°C (Collins et al, 2013), and that there is a small probability (of up to 10%) that ECS exceeds 6°C. \xa0 •  The UKCP18 factsheets on the available variables provide additional information on specific caveats   and limitations as well as information on how confident we are with the results available on the   UKCP18 website . 5.3 When should you use the regional and local projections? In addition to the benefits outlined in section 5.2, you should use the regional and/or local projections if you  are interested in: •  Applications where local scales are essential, as the regional and/or local projections better represent  local effects due to land elevation, coastlines and surface characteristics, as well as providing improved  resolution of dynamical features such as mesoscale circulations and frontal systems. •  Improved simulation of extremes with higher temporal variability (e.g. daily, subdaily). •  Extremes that explore future outcomes outside of the 90 th  percentile of the probabilistic projections   (e.g. changes in long-term average precipitation showing large increases in winter in some western  coastal regions). For example, you may wish to: •  Calculate future river flows and groundwater levels at the catchment scale for the UK (e.g. Prudhomme  et al, 2013). •  Understand the suitability of habitat for forest management in mountainous areas in Scotland   (e.g. demonstration project by Petr et al, 2018).  •  Investigate the impact of summer heat extremes in the future (e.g. Kershaw et al, 2010). •  Combine with the global projections to understand the effects of large-scale drivers at the local scale  (e.g. Palin et al, 2016). Before using the regional projections, you need to be aware of the following in addition to those outlined in  sections 3 and 5.2: •  The regional and/or local projections sample a narrower range of potential future outcomes compared to  the full set of global projections.

"How do UKCP Probabilistic vs. Regional projections differ for summer rainfall trends in England, given varying emissions and model uncertainties?","['chunk: 2.1  Considerations when using UKCP for rainfall applications Emissions Uncertainty:  The pathway we take for the emission of greenhouse gases  depends on demographic and socio-economic development over time as well as  technological change and the implementation of policy commitments.  A range of  emissions scenarios can be used to sample this uncertainty. The UKCP Probabilistic  projections provide the broadest overview using a range of emissions scenarios. The Global,  Regional and Local projections only sample a high emissions scenario, RCP8.5. A selection of these  projections are available at global warming levels (GWLs), which partly overcomes the availability of only  RCP8.5. GWLs represent the increase in surface temperatures averaged over the globe expressed relative  to the pre-industrial period (1850–1900). Using GWLs allows the assessment of changes in rainfall when  global temperatures reach, 1.5°C, 2°C and 4°C. Several GWLs are assessed as we do not yet know which  level will be reached as this depends on future greenhouse gas emis sions choices and the sensitivity of   the climate system. Model Uncertainty:  There are two types of model uncertainty – parameter uncertainty  and structural uncertainty. Parameter uncertainty arises from the inability of climate  models to resolve every process within the climate system, requiring the use of physical  equations and parameters. In UKCP, parameter uncertainty is assessed within the Met  Office’s Hadley Centre model (GC3.05-PPE) by perturbing model parameters within  expert-specified ranges to develop a range of simulations of the future climate, called the Perturbed  Parameter Ensemble (PPE). Uncertainty can arise from the structure of the climate model itself which influences how sensitive the  model is to the emission forcings, as well as the spatial and seasonal patterns of change that are  determined by changes in the regional processes or dynamics. This type of uncertainty can be assessed by  using a range of climate models. The UKCP Probabilistic, Global products and Probabilistic Extremes  products use both the Hadley Centre climate model (GC3.05-PPE) and models from CMIP5 (CMIP5-13).   The Hadley Centre model has a higher climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases compared to other models.  The UKCP Regional and Local currently only include downscaled versions of the Hadley Centre climate  model and sample a narrower range of structural uncertainty, however they capture parameter uncertainty  from the PPE. Figure 1 compares seasonal mean changes in precipitation (%) across all UKCP products for  Scotland and England. Changes in summer precipitation in England show a co nsiderable drying trend in the  Local and Regional projections (following the driving GC3.05-PPE), whereas the CMIP5 simulations and the  UKCP Probabilistic projections indicate more modest reductions or small increases in rainfall. It should be  noted that additional UKCP Regional and Local simulations downscaling selected members from CMIP5 will  be made available in 2024. These will provide wider uncertainty context for impacts studies. The  EuroCORDEX-UK project , funded through the UK Climate Resilience Programme, offers a facility to   supplement the UKCP Regional projections with information from a broader range of high-resolution  climate simulations from the EuroCORDEX downscaling experiment.  The additional projections will provide  a more comprehensive sampling of uncertainty in the high resolution UKCP projections.

How do precipitation changes impact water management and infrastructure strategy?,"['chunk: Precipitation, both rainfall and snowfall, can cause significant societal and economic impacts on various  timescales. Short, intense rainfall events (e.g. thunderstorms) can lead to pluvial or surface flooding as surface run-off  inundates small catchments and the urban landscape. Prolonged periods of excessive precipitation  saturates soil, increasing the risk of fluvial or river flooding. Above average precipitation for long periods can  ultimately lead to a raised water table, which can result in groundwater flooding in areas where the  geological characteristics are favourable. In the UK and Europe, flooding is one of the most economically  and socially disruptive natural hazards with impacts on transport, infrastructure and energy supply. Information on precipitation variability and future change is also critically important in water resource  management. Changes in precipitation patterns in the future – increases or decreases in totals on seasonal  or multi-year timescales – have implications for major investment and planning decisions made by UK public  and private sector organisations.

"""What role does the UK Storm Tide Forecasting Service play in coastal flood warnings?""","['chunk: Section summary: Our simulations are downscaled from general circulation models which evaluate well  against observed storm tracks (see section A2�2)� Simulated skew surges show a similar relationship  between changes of intensity and changes of frequency of extreme events to the relationship seen in  the tide-gauge records; in other words, the variability of the extremes is well-simulated� The components of our storm surge modelling system have been extensively evaluated: a very similar surge  model (CS3X) is used operationally to provide coastal flood warnings in the UK as part of the Storm Tide  Forecasting Service (STFS), and model performance is routinely monitored at the National Oceanography  Centre Liverpool by comparing forecast results with observations every month. Typical root-mean-square  errors are about 10cm (e.g. Furner et al, 2016 and  http://www.ntslf.org/storm-surges/storm-surge-model ).  The operational model has been shown to perform particularly well during extreme storm surges in the  southern North Sea (Horsburgh et al, 2008), forecasting surge in the Thames estuary to within 10cm when  driven by re-analysed meteorology. Further evaluation of the modelling system was reported in UKCP09  (Lowe et al, 2009) and TE2100 (Howard et al, 2008).  To make a comprehensive comparison of simulated extremes with observations for the historical period, we  compare return level curves of skew surge from nine tide gauges with the corresponding data from the  nearest grid-point in the surge model, in Figure A2.3.1.

In this context, a historical simulation means only that the  radiatively-active gas concentration is based on observations, whereas the reanalysis is an attempt to  reconstruct the weather of a period consistent with assimilation into a numerical weather prediction model.

What measures are taken to address unphysical seasonal anomalies in precipitation projections?,"['chunk: For precipitation, an additional change is applied to the calculation of these residuals. This arises from the  bounded nature of the variable: changes are expressed as percentages and cannot go below -100%, since  this indicates zero precipitation. However, the statistical application of scaling and sampling techniques to  responses expressed as percentage changes can occasionally lead to the lower bound being exceeded (see  Appendix A). The blue curve in Figure 2.5a shows an example of one such realization for projected July  precipitation changes in response to RCP85 forcing for the London administration region. It produces a  mean drying of -71% for the period 2070-2099, and nine individual years have a predicted drying  exceeding 100%. The blue curves in Figure 2.6 correspond to the probability distribution for the full sample  of realizations in Figure 2.5. A substantial fraction (16%) of unphysical seasonal anomalies occurs. For precipitation, these negative values were removed from the original realizations and pdfs in UKCP18, as  part of the clipping applied to extreme values (UKCP18 Technical Note, 2019). This happened in a minority  of cases, notably in southern locations during summer under strong forcing scenarios. An alternative  approach is to apply a logarithmic transformation to precipitation data prior to all statistical processing  (Watterson, 2008), followed by application of the inverse transform to later recover projections expressed  as percentage change:          ∆P (%) = 100(e y  - 1),  y = lnP - ln<P>    (2) where  <P>  represents the temporally-averaged precipitation P over the baseline period.  Two projections are made for precipitation at each grid point and season, one using percentage change and  one using the scaled log transform approach. The red curve in Figure 2.5a shows the realization  corresponding to the blue curve when the scaled log transform is used. By construction this avoids negative  precipitation events. Although similar, the noise characteristics of the two time-series can vary in some  details due to the non-linear properties of the log transform. However, use of the log transform for all  realizations can present other difficulties, as illustrated in Figure 2.5b. This shows the same variable as in  Figure 2.5a, but for a different sampled realization. In this instance, two individual years are predicted to be  above 500%. Across all 3000 sample realizations a few individual months with changes as high as 1800%  are obtained with the scaled log approach. These occasional large positive anomalies at the wet end of the  distribution are generated statistica lly and are implausible, as they are not supported by the underlying  RCM data. The largest positive precipitation anomaly found in the RCM simulations was about 310% and is  shown as the dashed line in Figure 2.5b. The statistical generation of these large positive anomalies is  explained further in Appendix A. The red curves in Figure 2.6 show the probability distribution for the full  sample of scaled log projections. A long tail in the cdf is clearly visible, representing the implausible, wet end  responses. At the dry end of the distribution, no realizations below -100% are permitted when using the log  transform. However, the probability (although small) is not identically equal to zero. This arises since we use  kernel density smoothing (Virtanen et al, 2020) to estimate the pdf, which introduces a small amount of  additional statistical spread (see below for further discussion).

What improvements do the Local 2.2km projections offer in representing snowfall and lying snow in the UK?,"['chunk: •  Both models represent the spatial variability well across the UK in winter  (i.e. greater snowfall in northern and highland areas). •  The winter-to-winter temporal variability in falling snow is better represented in the RCM. •  The winter-to-winter temporal variability in lying snow is better represented in the CPM. The differences between the RCM and CPM are mainly due to the differences in the way the models simulate  snowfall and the improved representation of topography in the CPM (see Kendon et al, 2019a, Section 3.5  for further details). In the updated Local 2.2km projections (released July 2021), there is a much improved  representation of snowfall and lying snow at the surface compared to the original Local 2.2km projections  (released September 2019). In general this leads to greater consistency between the CPM and RCM. The updated Local (2.2km) model produces more snowfall over the Scottish mountains and less in the  vicinity of the northwest coastline of Scotland compared to the RCM. There is also more lying snow over high  ground in Scotland in the CPM. These differences are likely explained by the higher resolution of the CPM  leading to a better representation of mountains, and the ability of the CPM to better represent the  movement of convective showers inland. Therefore, the Local (2.2km) projections provide the best  information available on snow in the UKCP suite of products, due to the better representation of topography  and wintertime convective showers. What do you need to be aware of? This factsheet details the biases in the data, though direct comparison with observations is difficult. Users  should be aware that both the Regional (12km) and Local (2.2km) projections underestimate uncertainties,  as they only downscale versions of the Met Office Hadley Centre model. Although the local projections can provide information on small-scale weather events in the future, they  should not be confused with an operational weather forecast, which provides information on weather that is  likely to be experienced in the next few days. Instead the local projections provide a set of plausible projections  of climate change for the UK, if we follow a high emission scenario (i.e. RCP8.5). In particular, they provide  information on the local effects of changes in the types of weather that may be experienced in the future.  The local projections sample a narrower range of potential future outcomes than the full set of global  projections. In particular, the regional climate models only downscale 12 members of the PPE-15 (and are in  turn downscaled using the CPM) and none of the CMIP5-13. If you would like to explore other potential  futures, consider using the EURO-CORDEX multi-model regional climate model simulations   (see  www.euro-cordex.net ).

What are the UKCP18 21st century time-mean sea level projections based on?,"['chunk: •  The global climate model projections also rely on global climate models with their inherent abilities and  limitations. However, the set includes the latest Met Office climate model (GC3.05) which has a greater  spatial detail than many other global models and many improvements to the treatment of atmospheric  physics compared to earlier models. This model performs better at replicating many observed aspects of  climate than earlier Met Office models, such as that used in producing the probabilistic projections, but  does focus more on the higher end of the range of future warming. The set of GC3.05 projections is  augmented with additional projections from IPCC CMIP5 models so that a wider range of future global  warming is simulated.  •  The sets of global and UK future climates has limited sizes and whilst it does cover a range of diverse  futures, it can not simulate every possible future climate. This is especially true of the regional climate  model set of projections which is not driven by any CMIP5 model simulations.  •  Downscaling – the process of generating model data at higher spatial and/or temporal resolution – adds  detail but also introduces another level of uncertainty. The additional information content is still valuable  for specific applications, but finer model spatial resolution does not necessarily provide greater  confidence, unless it has been shown to give a better representation of the underlying physical processes.  For instance, the 12 km model better resolves mountains and coastlines and land surface heterogeneities;  whilst the forthcoming 2.2 km model additionally better represents atmospheric convection offering  projections of changes on local and hourly scales in which we have greater confidence.  •  The derived scenario data uses approximate methods to produce an emulation of global climate model  projections for other scenarios or fixed global warming levels based on the projections for RCP8.5. This  introduces additional uncertainties and part of the method relies on an assumption of linearity in the  model which seems reasonable for CMIP5 models based on pattern-scaling studies but has not yet been  fully demonstrated for the Met Office global climate model output.  •  Global climate models will typically provide greater confidence for long-term climate averages than  extreme events or time series of daily or sub-daily values. For the climate simulations of sea levels, storm surges and waves users should note: •  The UKCP18 21 st  century time-mean sea level projections are based upon the 5 th  to 95 th  percentiles of  the underlying model distributions. However, there may be a greater than 10% chance that the real- world response lies outside the 5 th  to 95 th  percentile range and this likelihood cannot be accurately  quantified. For instance, we cannot rule out substantial additional sea level rise associated primarily with  dynamic ice discharge from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. We recommend that decision makers make  use of multiple strands of evidence, including H++ scenarios, where available, when assessing  vulnerabilities to future extreme water levels.   •   The 21 st  century projections presented in this report are predicated on the CMIP5 climate models and  the RCP climate change scenarios. The results are therefore subject to any inherent limitations of the  underlying model ensembles and assumed climate change scenarios.

What is the anticipated increase in site-specific projections due to the processing code correction in the UKCP18 sea-level projections?,"['chunk: The correction needed to the processing code was minimal and involved some simple refactoring of a few  lines so that baseline adjustments applied to the GMSL Monte Carlo data object were explicitly passed  through to the site-specific projections. The code fix was implemented by M.D. Palmer and then  independently checked by T. Howard. Following the refactoring of the code, the UKCP18 sea-level  projections were initially run for the four UK capital cities to check that the differences to the original  projections were consistent with the expected increase of approximately 1 cm, as discussed below. Once  this was confirmed, the code was re-run on all UKCP18 coastal grid boxes and checked against the original  projection data files. Finally, the updated projections were run on two independent software architectures  and the data files were cross-referenced and found to be a perfect match.  Since the baseline adjustment needed for GMSL was +1.1 cm it was anticipated that correction of the  processing code would lead to an approximately +1 cm (or 0.01 m) increase in site-specific projections on  all timescales. However, there is some additional subtlety due to the baseline adjustment being carried out  by individual sea-level components (see quoted text in section 2) and being convolved with the  corresponding spatial patterns of GRD (Gravity, Rotation and solid-earth Deformation, (Gregory et al.,  2019)) and local scaling between global and local expressions of sea-level change simulated by CMIP5  models (e.g., M. D. Palmer et al., 2020). These subtleties result in some small time/space dependence of the  approximate +1 cm offset. At 2100, the differences across all percentiles between the updated and original  UKCP18 projections show a range of about 0.8 cm to 1.3 cm (or 0.008 to 0.013 m, Figure 1). For the  exploratory extended UKCP18 projections at 2300, the range is a bout 0.4 cm to 1.8 cm (or 0.004 to   0.018 m, not shown).

What are the implications of using the high emissions RCP8.5 scenario in the UKCP Local Transient Projections?,"['chunk: This report accompanies the release of UKCP Local (2.2km) Projections for additional transient periods  (2001-2020 and 2041-2060), leading to 100y climate simulations for 1981-2080 that continuously span  past, present and future times, at 2.2km scale for the UK (Kendon et al., 2023). While it is common practice  in the international community to produce ensembles of continuous transient simulations using global and  regional climate models, this is (to our knowledge) the first example of such an ensemble at the kilometre  scale, with the same level of spatial detail as weather forecast models. This unique set of projections  therefore provides a key step forward in national climate capability allowing the examination of how  changes in local weather extremes may be realised over the coming years and decades. Since twelve  simulations are available, we can determine robustly their projected signals in local extremes. The transient  simulations provide a set of plausible outcomes for ea ch year through time, allowing us to put observed  events into the context of climate change.  The new 2.2km simulations augment the UKCP Local (2.2km) Projections previously updated in July 2021,  which provided data for three 20-year periods (1981-2000, 2021-40 and 2061-80). The new 2.2km  simulations provide data for the intervening periods (2001-2020 and 2041-60) and consist of twelve  ensemble members, downscaling the UKCP Regional (12km) Projections as in UKCP Local (2.2km). This  results in 100y timeseries data spanning 1981-2080 and driven by a high emissions (RCP8.5) scenario  (hereafter “UKCP Local Transient Projections”). Since each ensemble member timeseries is built by joining  five 20y simulations, there are discontinuities at the time-slice boundaries (1st of December 2000, 2020,  2040 and 2060), which means there may be an abrupt shift in the daily weather on those four dates. The  20-year simulations were preceded by a 1-year spin-up to help ensure there was only a discontinuity in the  simulated daily weather at the boundaries but not in the underlying climate  characteristics.  The set-up of  the UKCP Local projections is as described in Kendon et al., (2021a).  The km-scale (“convection-permitting”) model is able to better represent the small-scale behaviour seen in  the atmosphere, in particular atmospheric convection – a key process driving many of our extreme weather  events. Due to the high spatial resolution, compared to more traditional climate models, it also represents  better the influence of mountains, coastlines and cities. As such the UKCP Local (2.2km) data are useful for  impacts assessments that require enhanced spatial detail or information on changes in extreme weather at  local and hourly timescales (Dale et al., 2018; Slater et al., 2022; Chan et al., 2022). The UKCP Local  Transient Projections provide access to credible information on how climate change may impact extremes  of weather for your local area over the coming years out to 2080. They provide a range of plausible  outcomes for any given year, which, whilst not comprehensive, is expected to be valuable to urban planners,  local authorities and flood management pra ctitioners for adaptation planning. All projections are for the high emissions RCP8.5 scenario which, although not the most likely, remains a  plausible scenario assuming unmitigated greenhouse gas emissions. This scenario was chosen as it provides  a high signal-to-noise ratio, allowing us to robustly capture the climate change signal above natural  variability, that is also useful in inferring changes for other scenarios (for example through characterising  changes for a given degree of global warming, see section “Example applications of new UKCP Local  Transient Projections”). It provides an upper estimate that supports precautionary planning in relation to  future risks of extremes.

What are the differences between CPM and RCM climate projections as outlined in the UKCP18 report?,"['chunk: •  The CPM results do not change the UKCP18 headline message of a greater chance of warmer wetter  winters and hotter drier summers across the UK in future (Lowe et al, 2018). For 2061-80, under a high  emission scenario (RCP8.5), the CPM ensemble suggests winters will be warmer by 1.8-3.3ºC 1  and  wetter by 16-42%, whilst summers will be hotter by 3.6-5.0ºC and drier by 16-46%. In general the CPM  reinforces the results from the 12km RCM, projecting similar overall changes to UK climate. However the  CPM results do provide new information in terms of winter mean precipitation changes, changes in  extremes and changes at local scales (Section 4, Table 5.1). •  Mean temperature increases everywhere and in all seasons in future, with the greatest increases  occurring in the south. The CPM ensemble shows increases in hot summer days (3.7-6.8ºC 1  increase by  the 2070s under RCP8.5) and the frequency of hot spells, reinforcing the results of the RCM. In winter,  there is a smaller increase in temperature over Scotland in the CPM compared to the RCM, with a  smaller increase in the temperature of cold winter days and a smaller decrease in the frequency of  intense cold spells. These differences are likely related to differences in lying snow, with a greater  decrease in lying snow in the future in the RCM. •  Average winter precipitation increases in future, with the possible exception of northern Scotland where  decreases are possible. We find that the CPM shows much greater increases than the RCM (27%  compared to 16% increase 2 ), due to greater increases in the number of wet days. This may be because it  rains so often in the present-day in the RCM that there is little scope for this to increase further, although  more research is needed to investigate this. Also the better representation of convective showers and  their movement inland in the CPM may be a factor. •  Average summer precipitation decreases in future in the CPM ensemble, again with the possible  exception of northern Scotland. The average changes are broadly consistent between the CPM and RCM  ensembles, but the underlying changes in rainfall on a day-to-day and hour-to-hour basis are quite  different. In particular, it rains less often in the future, but the rain is heavier when it does – and this shift  to more intense rainfall in summer is more pronounced in the CPM projections. These changes in rainfall  are primarily driven by increased moisture in the atmosphere with warming, leading to heavier rainfall,  which is captured by both the CPM and RCM. However, local processes within the storms themselves  can amplify increases, and these are only represented in the CPM projections. •  Hourly precipitation extremes increase in future. The CPM shows increases of 25% 3  in the precipitation  associated with an event that occurs typically once every 2 years. RCM projections for hourly extremes  are considered unreliable. Use of projections •  The release of the CPM projections provides further capability to the UKCP18 suite of climate projection  tools.

Therefore, we  advise using the Local (2.2km) projections in parallel with other products in the UKCP18 toolkit. 1.8 The new UKCP Local (2.2km) provides, for the first time, national climate change information on a  similar resolution to that of current operational weather forecast models.  Local (2.2km) allows us to  simulate better the type of small-scale behaviour seen in the real atmosphere, including atmospheric  convection 2 , as well as the influence of mountains, coastlines and urban areas.

Local (2.2km) provides data at kilometre and  hourly scales that can be directly fed into impact models and local decision-making tools.

"""What are the benefits of using probabilistic projections for estimating uncertainty in climate variables?""","['chunk: This will depend on your application (see Figure 3) and you should consider:  •  If your primary need is access to estimates of uncertainty in climate variables, the probabilistic  projections should be your main source of information. They provide an estimate of the probability  associated with a given level of climate change, subject to the caveats listed in this document. They also  provide a percentile range that covers a given level of risk aversion. These levels or “ranges” can be  compared qualitatively against various vulnerabilities in your system of interest. As stated earlier, if your  decision is sensitive to relative likelihood or focused heavily on specific probability levels, you should test  the sensitivity of your results. •  If you are carrying out an impacts study and interested in looking at weather events that have length of  days rather than months that affect different geographical locations simultaneously then use the global  and regional projections.  •  If you are interested in exploring futures that are outside of the 10 th -90 th  percentiles of the probabilistic  projections, there may be some global, regional or CPM projections that exhibit this behaviour for certain  variables that you could use. You may also consider searching for an alternative source, such as other  climate model projections not included in UKCP18. •  Whether the variables and time frequency (e.g. daily) that you are interested is available in a particular  strand of information. For example, wind direction is only available for the global and regional projections  and hourly to 3-hourly information is only available from the CPM projections. •  Whether you wish to use a combination of more than one set of projections for some applications.

What do UK tide gauge records indicate about year-to-year changes in coastal water levels?,"['chunk: •  UK tide gauge records show substantial year-to-year changes in coastal water levels (typically several  centimetres). We recommend that coastal decision makers account for this variability in risk  assessments, particularly for shorter-term planning horizons. Numerical modelling results presented in  this report suggest that variability observed at tide gauge sites is typically representative of long sections  of coastline (section 3.1.4).  •  The risk of coastal flood events will rise in accord with the projections of increase in time-mean sea level.  However, based on storm surge modelling work, we suggest a best estimate of no significant additional  increase in the statistics of extreme water levels associated with atmospheric storminess change only.  The largest trend found in our ensemble of surge simulations of this additional component corresponds  to a change of approximately 10cm per century for the 1-year return level, i.e. about 10% of the time- mean sea level change under the same RCP climate change scenario (section 3.2). We cannot rule out  larger trends in storm surge due to this additional component. This additional component could be either  positive (augmenting the time-mean sea level change) or negative (partially offsetting the time-mean  sea level change).  •  21 st  century projections of average wave height suggest changes of the order 10-20% and a general  tendency towards lower wave heights. Changes in extreme waves are also of order 10-20%, but there is  no agreement in the sign of change among the model projections. High resolution wave simulations  suggest that the changes in wave climate over the 21 st  century on exposed coasts will be dominated by  the global response to climate change. However, more sheltered coastal regions are likely to remain  dominated by local weather variability over the 21 st  century (section 3.3).  •  Exploratory, time-mean sea level projections to 2300 suggest that UK sea levels will continue to rise over  the coming centuries under all RCP climate change scenarios. For London and Cardiff the projection ranges  at 2300 are approximately 0.5 - 2.2m, 0.8 - 2.6m and 1.4 - 4.3m for RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5,  respectively. The values for Edinburgh and Belfast are substantially lower, with corresponding ranges at  2300 of approximately 0.0 - 1.7m, 0.2 - 2.1m and 0.7 - 3.6m. Compared to the 21 st  century projections,  there is a much larger degree of unquantified uncertainty associated with sea level information on these  extended time horizons. Therefore, these projections should be considered as illustrative of the potential  future changes and provide an approximate set of scenarios against which vulnerabilities can be assessed.  •  Idealised tidal simulations suggest that time-mean sea level change greater than about 1m could have a  substantial impact on tidal amplitude and other tidal characteristics around the UK, with large spatial  variations.

What does the UKCP18 project reveal about future climate variability and changes?,"['chunk: The probabilistic projections discussed in the previous section provide context for how the projected future  climate might change, including providing information on the range of changes for different future  greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Many users have expressed a desire for also having a set of global and  regional climate model projections that represent how variability and long-term changes in climate might  evolve over the UK (and beyond) over the 21 st  century. Our design philosophy in UKCP18 has been to use  the most recent climate models to provide this evidence. This approach is consistent with a growing  interest by users in constructing internally consistent, physically based storylines that help us understand  the robustness of those particular futures that would be most relevant to a particular user. There is no  single climate projection that can provide this because different users have different interests and weather  vulnerabilities. Therefore, the UKCP18 set o f global model projections provides 28 plausible but diverse  projections from which to choose. The set comprises projections with the GC3.05 model and other CMIP5  models. Many of the global simulations from the GC3.05 model have been downscaled to a 12km scale and  will be further downscaled to 2.2km in future. The global and regional model projections are provided for  the RCP8.5 scenario.  The global model projections are shown as a time-series and compared to the spread from the probabilistic  projections in Figure 2.13 for global mean temperature change. It is clear that the GC3.05 models tend to  sample the warmer end of the future response range projected by the probabilistic approach and CMIP5  models sample the mid-range and colder end – with some limited overlap in the middle. This is consistent  with recent research into a HADGEM3 model version (GC3.1), to which the UKCP18 GC3.05 versions of the  model are closely related, having an equilibrium climate sensitivity above the likely end of the current IPCC  range, and higher than the CMIP5 set of models. However, potential users should note that the projected  response over the UK has a wider spread in both GC3.05 and CMIP5 projection sets and the degree of  overlap of the sets is greater. There is also a greater overlap for some metrics, such as precipitation.

However, they may not capture all possible future outcomes. The set of global and UK future climates has limited sizes and whilst it does cover a range of futures (with  the Met Office set of global models providing the higher end of future global temperatures), it cannot  simulate every possible future climate. This is especially true of the regional model (and consequently the  convection-permitting model used in the local (2.2km) projections) which is not driven by any climate  model simulations that fed into IPCC AR5 (i.e. CMIP5 climate models). Neither the set based on global  models, or that based on regional and convection-permitting models have been designed to support  estimates of the relative likelihood of alternative outcomes within their ranges of response, nor have they  been constructed to replicate the probabilistic projections.  The 21 st  century surge and wave projections are based upon relatively small set of CMIP5 models. It is  unlikely that these simulations span the full range of CMIP5 model responses under climate change. In  particular, these projections should be viewed as indicative of the overall magnitude of changes we might see  over the 21 st  Century.  For both the surge and wave projections, we are unable to quantify the relative  influence of the climate change signal and natural variability on the simulated changes over the 21 st  Century. 5.

You should  interpret the probabilities as being an indication of how much the evidence from models and observations  taken together in our methodology support a particular future climate outcome.  The relative probabilities indicate how strongly the evidence from models and observations, taken together  in our methodology, support alternative future climate outcomes. There is more evidence for outcomes  near the centre of the distribution than in the tails, so we see unimodal (single-peaked) distributions. In  these, the relative probabilities for specific outcomes are typically much higher near the 50% cumulative  probability level (median) of the distribution, than for outcomes lying either below the 10% cumulative  probability level or above the 90% cumulative probability level. As mentioned above, the probabilities are conditioned on methodological choices and expert judgement.  The results may change if a different methodology is used.

What are the differences between CPM and RCM climate projections as described in the UKCP18 report?,"['chunk: •  The CPM results do not change the UKCP18 headline message of a greater chance of warmer wetter  winters and hotter drier summers across the UK in future (Lowe et al, 2018). For 2061-80, under a high  emission scenario (RCP8.5), the CPM ensemble suggests winters will be warmer by 1.8-3.3ºC 1  and  wetter by 16-42%, whilst summers will be hotter by 3.6-5.0ºC and drier by 16-46%. In general the CPM  reinforces the results from the 12km RCM, projecting similar overall changes to UK climate. However the  CPM results do provide new information in terms of winter mean precipitation changes, changes in  extremes and changes at local scales (Section 4, Table 5.1). •  Mean temperature increases everywhere and in all seasons in future, with the greatest increases  occurring in the south. The CPM ensemble shows increases in hot summer days (3.7-6.8ºC 1  increase by  the 2070s under RCP8.5) and the frequency of hot spells, reinforcing the results of the RCM. In winter,  there is a smaller increase in temperature over Scotland in the CPM compared to the RCM, with a  smaller increase in the temperature of cold winter days and a smaller decrease in the frequency of  intense cold spells. These differences are likely related to differences in lying snow, with a greater  decrease in lying snow in the future in the RCM. •  Average winter precipitation increases in future, with the possible exception of northern Scotland where  decreases are possible. We find that the CPM shows much greater increases than the RCM (27%  compared to 16% increase 2 ), due to greater increases in the number of wet days. This may be because it  rains so often in the present-day in the RCM that there is little scope for this to increase further, although  more research is needed to investigate this. Also the better representation of convective showers and  their movement inland in the CPM may be a factor. •  Average summer precipitation decreases in future in the CPM ensemble, again with the possible  exception of northern Scotland. The average changes are broadly consistent between the CPM and RCM  ensembles, but the underlying changes in rainfall on a day-to-day and hour-to-hour basis are quite  different. In particular, it rains less often in the future, but the rain is heavier when it does – and this shift  to more intense rainfall in summer is more pronounced in the CPM projections. These changes in rainfall  are primarily driven by increased moisture in the atmosphere with warming, leading to heavier rainfall,  which is captured by both the CPM and RCM. However, local processes within the storms themselves  can amplify increases, and these are only represented in the CPM projections. •  Hourly precipitation extremes increase in future. The CPM shows increases of 25% 3  in the precipitation  associated with an event that occurs typically once every 2 years. RCM projections for hourly extremes  are considered unreliable. Use of projections •  The release of the CPM projections provides further capability to the UKCP18 suite of climate projection  tools.

What are the general findings from the evaluation of UKCP18 and CMIP6 historical simulations regarding their performance in simulating climate variables?,"['chunk: a.   Evaluation of UKCP18 and CMIP6 historical simulations   We revisited the set of global coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations included in the UKCP-Global  component of UKCP18, using the CMIP6 ensemble as a new comparative benchmark. Despite the  general improvements in CMIP6 models compared to CMIP5, the historical performance of UKCP-Global  simulations is competitive with CMIP6 models. This applies to seasonal climatologies of surface air  temperature and precipitation, in which systematic regional biases in CMIP6 are similar to those in the  perturbed parameter and multi-model ensembles contributing members to UKCP-Global (see section  2b). The same applies to annual climatologies for a broader set of climate variables, particularly in the  case of the perturbed parameter ensemble (GC3.05-PPE). The PPE is derived from a model closely  related to HadGEM3-GC3.1, the configuration contributed by the Met Office to the CMIP6 ensemble.  Three major modes of coupled-ocean-atmosphere variability (ENSO, AMV and winter NAO), all of  which exert important influences on European climate, were also evaluated.  All UKCP-Global and most  CMIP6 simulations exceed the observed amplitude of interannual variations in NAO. For AMV, all CMIP6  members simulate greater interannual variability than observed, while UKCP-Global members exhibit a  range of biases of either sign. Observed and simulated estimates are subject to significant sampling  uncertainties across different periods, so in many cases the simulation biases are not statistically  significant. However, some models do show ranges of variability that fail to overlap with observations,  especially for some CMIP6 simulations of AMV. A caveat is that AMV exhibits significant variability on  the centennial time scale (Mavilia et al., 2018), limiting the extent to which firm conclusions can be  drawn from the 1900-2005 time series considered here. For ENSO amplitude (measured using monthly  anomalies in the NINO3.4 index), uncertainty ranges from all but one UKCP-Global members overlap  substantially with observations. This is also true for many CMIP6 members, though a minority simulate  ENSO variability that is clearly too low or too large.  By the most recent decade (2010-2020), the observed change in global mean surface temperature  (GMST) relative to 1900-1930 amounts to ~1.0°C. This lies near the middle of the distributions simulated  by the CMIP6 and UKCP-Global ensembles, whose ranges of change are similar. During 1960-1990, most  GC3.05-PPE members and some CMIP6 members simulate GMST anomalies cooler than observations,  due at least partly to strong negative forcing from anthropogenic aerosol emissions. However, most  GC3.05-PPE simulations warm more rapidly than observations beyond 1990, removing the earlier cool  bias by the 2010s.          In this report CMIP6 data was assembled for evaluation on a simple “one-model-one-vote” basis.  In contrast, members of UKCP-Global were selected from wider sets of CMIP5 models and GC3.05  perturbed parameter variants, through application of screening criteria to identify a subset of high- quality simulations offering a diversity of projected future changes.

What are the uncertainties in climate projections related to derived projections and tide and surge simulations?,"['chunk: Additional caveats and limitations come with:  •  Derived projections. •  Extended exploratory time-mean sea level projections.  •  Tide and surge simulations. The derived projections over UK land areas use approximate methods to produce an estimate of RCP2.6  and global warming levels of 2 and 4 ° C (compared to pre-industrial). This introduces additional  uncertainties. One of the major assumptions is that we can use the climate model time series that reach  particular warming levels through the 21 st  century (transient) to inform a future that has reached a steady  warming level (stabilized). There is some evidence that future climate outcomes at a particular global  warming level can differ depending on whether that warming level is transient or stabilized (e.g. Ceppi et al,  2018). See UKCP18 Derived Scenarios Report (Gohar et al, 2018).  The extended exploratory time-mean sea level projections have much lower confidence than the 21 st   Century Projections. Consider these projections as sensitivity studies and do not interpret them as showing  the full range of post-2100 behaviour, or the most likely behaviour. The potential for additional sea level rise  from Antarctic dynamic ice discharge is even more uncertain on these time horizons, with some studies  suggesting several additional metres of rise by 2300 under RCP8.5.  The simulations of changes in tide and surge characteristics make the simple assumption of a fixed  coastline under all levels of future sea level rise.  10.  Take care when comparing/combining variables When carrying out analyses that consider more than one variable, ensure that any outcomes are consistent  and coherent in their representation of the changes. For the probabilistic projections, there is no spatial  coherence. For the global, regional, local and derived projections ensure that you choose variables from the  same member of the set of projections. For example, summer temperature from one member is unlikely to  be consistent with precipitation from another. Choosing a model based on being amongst the largest of the probabilistic climate changes in summer  does not necessarily translate into the same model being in such an extreme position in the winter  change results.

How are changes in storm track intensity related to changes in the equator-to-pole temperature gradient and vertical stratification?,"['chunk: •  As climate warms, surface shortwave cloud radiative changes increase the equator-to-pole temperature  gradient, but at the same time, longwave cloud radiative changes reduce this gradient. •  Some idealised simulations have shown that warming of the tropical upper troposphere increases  equator-to-pole temperature gradient and shifts the storm tracks poleward. However, Arctic surface  warming decreases lower tropospheric equator-to-pole temperature gradient and shifts the storm  tracks equatorward. •  In coupled atmosphere-ocean models, warming of the polar lower stratosphere due to ozone hole  recovery decreases equator-to-pole temperature gradient and shifts the storm tracks equatorward;  however, increased greenhouse gases lead to warming of the tropical upper troposphere, cooling of the  lower stratosphere and a poleward storm track shift. •  Latent heat transport increases in mid-latitudes in coupled atmosphere-ocean models, in response to  increased CO 2 , consistent with thermodynamic arguments. However, total energy transport does not  change by as much because the increased latent energy transport is partially compensated for by  decreased dry static energy transport. •  Changes in mean available potential energy, which are related to changes in storm track intensity, are  sensitive to competition between changes in equator-to-pole temperature gradient and vertical  stratification. This diversity and competition makes projections of the storm track response to climate change less robust  than, for example, the global mean temperature response (Shepherd, 2014). There are substantial  differences between models in the way simulated atmospheric circulation responds to imposed greenhouse  gas forcing. In UKCP09 this uncertainty was addressed by producing storm surge model simulations forced  by an ensemble of climate models. This ensemble was generated by adjusting the atmospheric physics  parameters of a single climate model. The resulting range of extreme-sea level response (as measured by  the change in sea level extremes due to change in atmospheric storminess alone) was found to be small.   For some metrics, the range of response sampled by a perturbed physics ensemble (PPE) is not the same as  the range of response sampled by a multi-model ensemble (MME). Two examples are the regional mean sea  level response, discussed by Pardaens et al, (2011), where the PPE  range is smaller than the MME range,  and the north-east Atlantic atmospheric storminess response as measured by band-pass filtered  atmospheric pressure at sea level, discussed by Lowe et al, (2011), where the PPE and MME exhibit  different responses in terms of the intensity and latitude of the maximum variability near the UK.   The resourcing and timing of the UKCP18 marine work did not allow for forcing with both PPE and MME and  so, in view of the small size of the range of response found using a PPE in UKCP09, in UKCP18 we elected to  address the storm-track-response uncertainty by forcing the storm surge model with data from several  different climate models (i.e. a limited multi-model ensemble).

What are the UKCP18 21st century time-mean sea level projections based on?,"['chunk: •  The global climate model projections also rely on global climate models with their inherent abilities and  limitations. However, the set includes the latest Met Office climate model (GC3.05) which has a greater  spatial detail than many other global models and many improvements to the treatment of atmospheric  physics compared to earlier models. This model performs better at replicating many observed aspects of  climate than earlier Met Office models, such as that used in producing the probabilistic projections, but  does focus more on the higher end of the range of future warming. The set of GC3.05 projections is  augmented with additional projections from IPCC CMIP5 models so that a wider range of future global  warming is simulated.  •  The sets of global and UK future climates has limited sizes and whilst it does cover a range of diverse  futures, it can not simulate every possible future climate. This is especially true of the regional climate  model set of projections which is not driven by any CMIP5 model simulations.  •  Downscaling – the process of generating model data at higher spatial and/or temporal resolution – adds  detail but also introduces another level of uncertainty. The additional information content is still valuable  for specific applications, but finer model spatial resolution does not necessarily provide greater  confidence, unless it has been shown to give a better representation of the underlying physical processes.  For instance, the 12 km model better resolves mountains and coastlines and land surface heterogeneities;  whilst the forthcoming 2.2 km model additionally better represents atmospheric convection offering  projections of changes on local and hourly scales in which we have greater confidence.  •  The derived scenario data uses approximate methods to produce an emulation of global climate model  projections for other scenarios or fixed global warming levels based on the projections for RCP8.5. This  introduces additional uncertainties and part of the method relies on an assumption of linearity in the  model which seems reasonable for CMIP5 models based on pattern-scaling studies but has not yet been  fully demonstrated for the Met Office global climate model output.  •  Global climate models will typically provide greater confidence for long-term climate averages than  extreme events or time series of daily or sub-daily values. For the climate simulations of sea levels, storm surges and waves users should note: •  The UKCP18 21 st  century time-mean sea level projections are based upon the 5 th  to 95 th  percentiles of  the underlying model distributions. However, there may be a greater than 10% chance that the real- world response lies outside the 5 th  to 95 th  percentile range and this likelihood cannot be accurately  quantified. For instance, we cannot rule out substantial additional sea level rise associated primarily with  dynamic ice discharge from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. We recommend that decision makers make  use of multiple strands of evidence, including H++ scenarios, where available, when assessing  vulnerabilities to future extreme water levels.   •   The 21 st  century projections presented in this report are predicated on the CMIP5 climate models and  the RCP climate change scenarios. The results are therefore subject to any inherent limitations of the  underlying model ensembles and assumed climate change scenarios.

Introduction The project was developed to provide forestry practitioners, primarily in the UK, but also across Europe, with a means of identifying appropriate seed origins to enable the planting of species that are likely to be tolerant of future climate conditions. The information was to be made available in a web interface, the  Climate Matching Tool , that allowed foresters to access 12 km spatial resolution climate data for Europe and the Pacific Northwest. The project was funded by Forestry Commission with resources from the EU funded B4est Project. Figure 1. The  climate matching tool  in operation. A climate difference (CD) score closest to zero (darker red colours) are the areas have closest match to the selected site (denoted by the tree logo, here in eastern Scotland). The site comparison can be chosen based on: a) Precipitation only b) Temperature & diurnal range c) Precipitation, temperature & diurnal range For a range of future time periods and for one of two questions: 1. Which areas currently have my future climate? Or 2. Which areas will have my current climate in the future? Using The Climate Matching Tool The  Climate Matching Tool  is a web based tool that allows users to match the climatic conditions of sites of interest with future climates. For example, a forester in eastern Scotland can observe how their site might be analogous with northern Spain in the future. This allows the user to consider assisted migration (planting seeds of species from southerly latitudes) as a means of climate mitigation for key native and non native species. Users select their area of interest (eastern Scotland in Fig.1) and then choose the question, future time period and climate information. Future time periods extend out to 2079, as many trees planted today will have an intended lifespan of over 80 years (particularly for forests intended as carbon sinks) Users are presented with climate difference (CD) score with a score of zero matching the target climate conditions exactly. The heat map shows the distribution of these CD scores, to enable easy interpretation of the results and the target areas for potential new species.']","The Climate Matching Tool assists forestry practitioners by providing a web-based interface to access 12 km spatial resolution climate data for Europe and the Pacific Northwest.

What role does the improved representation of topography play in the accuracy of the CPM model for predicting snowfall and lying snow in Scotland?,"['chunk: •  Both models represent the spatial variability well across the UK in winter  (i.e. greater snowfall in northern and highland areas). •  The winter-to-winter temporal variability in falling snow is better represented in the RCM. •  The winter-to-winter temporal variability in lying snow is better represented in the CPM. The differences between the RCM and CPM are mainly due to the differences in the way the models simulate  snowfall and the improved representation of topography in the CPM (see Kendon et al, 2019a, Section 3.5  for further details). In the updated Local 2.2km projections (released July 2021), there is a much improved  representation of snowfall and lying snow at the surface compared to the original Local 2.2km projections  (released September 2019). In general this leads to greater consistency between the CPM and RCM. The updated Local (2.2km) model produces more snowfall over the Scottish mountains and less in the  vicinity of the northwest coastline of Scotland compared to the RCM. There is also more lying snow over high  ground in Scotland in the CPM. These differences are likely explained by the higher resolution of the CPM  leading to a better representation of mountains, and the ability of the CPM to better represent the  movement of convective showers inland. Therefore, the Local (2.2km) projections provide the best  information available on snow in the UKCP suite of products, due to the better representation of topography  and wintertime convective showers. What do you need to be aware of? This factsheet details the biases in the data, though direct comparison with observations is difficult. Users  should be aware that both the Regional (12km) and Local (2.2km) projections underestimate uncertainties,  as they only downscale versions of the Met Office Hadley Centre model. Although the local projections can provide information on small-scale weather events in the future, they  should not be confused with an operational weather forecast, which provides information on weather that is  likely to be experienced in the next few days. Instead the local projections provide a set of plausible projections  of climate change for the UK, if we follow a high emission scenario (i.e. RCP8.5). In particular, they provide  information on the local effects of changes in the types of weather that may be experienced in the future.  The local projections sample a narrower range of potential future outcomes than the full set of global  projections.

"""What are the flooding risks associated with different types of precipitation events?""","['chunk: Precipitation, both rainfall and snowfall, can cause significant societal and economic impacts on various  timescales. Short, intense rainfall events (e.g. thunderstorms) can lead to pluvial or surface flooding as surface run-off  inundates small catchments and the urban landscape. Prolonged periods of excessive precipitation  saturates soil, increasing the risk of fluvial or river flooding. Above average precipitation for long periods can  ultimately lead to a raised water table, which can result in groundwater flooding in areas where the  geological characteristics are favourable. In the UK and Europe, flooding is one of the most economically  and socially disruptive natural hazards with impacts on transport, infrastructure and energy supply. Information on precipitation variability and future change is also critically important in water resource  management. Changes in precipitation patterns in the future – increases or decreases in totals on seasonal  or multi-year timescales – have implications for major investment and planning decisions made by UK public  and private sector organisations.

What are probabilistic projections as described in the UKCP09 component?,"['chunk: The UKCP18 land projections have been designed to replace the previous UKCP09 scenarios (Jenkins et al.,  2009), taking into account subsequent feedback from users and developments in modelling capability. The  new projections consist of three Strands, described in detail in sections 2-4. The Strands are built to serve  types of user requirement that are related, but also somewhat distinct, and each Strand uses different  climate modelling inputs. For some applications it may be appropriate to consider combining information  from two or more Strands to obtain the most comprehensive advice (section 5.2). The Strands include some  inter-dependencies in their designs, to help with this. Below, we discuss how developments since UKCP09  have informed the content of UKCP18, and introduce the three Strands. We describe and evaluate their  underpinning projection systems in more detail in sections 2-4, and compare their future projections in  section 5. This includes discussion of how the resu lts should be interpreted and used, taking into  consideration the nature of the products and the degree of consistency between their results. A summary is  provided in section 6.   1.1. Recap of UKCP09 The centrepiece of the UKCP09 land component was a set of probabilistic projections (Murphy et al., 2009).  These expressed a broad range of plausible outcomes for UK climate during the 21 st  century, for a set of key  climate variables. They were provided for three future emissions pathways (the B1, A1B and A1FI scenarios  of Nakicenovic and Swart (2000), labelled “low”, “medium” and “high”), for a national 25km grid and two  sets of aggregated regions. The probabilistic projections were presented as 30-year monthly, seasonal and  annual average changes, expressed relative to a 1961-1990 baseline. They represented known  uncertainties (due to internal climate variability and the modelling of key Earth system processes),  consistent with available climate model simulations and the knowledge contained within them. The  projections were constructed from several ensembles of variants of a single climate model (HadCM3),  representing modelling uncertainties by perturbing model parameters  within expert-specified ranges. These  perturbed parameter ensembles (PPEs) were combined with results from the Coupled Model  Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) ensemble of international global climate models (GCMs), and a  set of observational metrics of historical model performance (Sexton et al., 2012; Harris et al., 2013). A  weather generator (Jones et al., 2010) was also provided. This was driven by change factors sampled from  the projections in order to assess localised impacts and risks in many applications. The UKCP09 projections  were the first UK scenarios to include intrinsic, quantitative estimates of uncertainty. They formed a major  component of the evidence bases for the first and second national climate change risk assessments  (CCRA), published in 2012 ( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-climate-change-risk- assessment-government-report ) and 2017 (CCRA2, see  https://www.theccc.org.uk/tackling-climate- change/preparing-for-climate-change/uk-climate-change-risk-assessment-2017/ ).

What are the advantages of using Local (2.2km) projections for climate change information?,"['chunk: The new Local (2.2km) provides the most physically realistic projections of extremes in local areas for  the coming decades and gives access to sub-daily information.  But, like the Regional (12km), Local (2.2km)  projections span a narrower range of uncertainty compared to the Global (60km) projections. Therefore, we  advise using the Local (2.2km) projections in parallel with other products in the UKCP18 toolkit. 1.8 The new UKCP Local (2.2km) provides, for the first time, national climate change information on a  similar resolution to that of current operational weather forecast models.  Local (2.2km) allows us to  simulate better the type of small-scale behaviour seen in the real atmosphere, including atmospheric  convection 2 , as well as the influence of mountains, coastlines and urban areas. Locally relevant information  can help to inform decision-making on future climate change, to enhance resilience, and adds further  capability to the UKCP18 suite of climate projection tools. 1.9 The new Local (2.2km) projections provide output at hourly scales which is needed for some user  applications, better informing future risk assessments.  Local (2.2km) provides data at kilometre and  hourly scales that can be directly fed into impact models and local decision-making tools. For example,  hourly rainfall data can be used to inform future changes in surface water flood risk for urban flood  management schemes and contingency planners. Data on future extreme heat can be used for decision- making around key infrastructure including bridges, trainlines and thermal performance of buildings. 1.10 Climate science is continually advancing.

Introduction Bristol City Council needed an overview of Bristol’s past and future climate that could build a foundation of collective understanding within the council. The factsheets were then used to engage with a range of stakeholders to inform conversations and decision-making around planning and resilience/climate strategies. Three Factsheets were produced using historical weather data for Bristol and the UKCP Probabilistic Projections to investigate future changes in the climate of Bristol. Due to its coastal location, the UKCP Marine projections were also included. The Factsheets were funded as part of the UK Government Strategic Priorities Fund programme on UK Climate Resilience . The Factsheets Bristol Climate Change: The Science  highlights the different factors influencing the weather of Bristol, for example both wind and rain are dominated by the interaction between the weather and the local landscape (Exmoor, the Welsh Mountains and the Severn Estuary). Additionally, it displays the Bristol “Climate Stripes”, highlighting the change in annual temperature for Bristol between 1887 and 2018. Bristol Climate Change: The Results Explained Feedback The Factsheets have been well received by Bristol City Council and  have been used  to inform the Bristol City Council climate resilience strategy. The Factsheets have resonated with Bristolians due to the local focus of the information. They enabled an improved understanding of the impact of changes in the local climate providing the basis for the need to take action on climate change. The success of the Bristol City Council Factsheets has resulted in them being replicated in other cities. introduces the UKCP tools that are used to project future changes in Bristol’s climate.

What impact does the Atlantic overturning circulation have on the climate model simulations according to the UKCP Global report?,"['chunk: Background:  UKCP Global (60 km) consisted of 28 realisations of climate variables for 1900-2100 as  simulated by 28 coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models. The 28 realisations consisted of 15 variants of  the HadGEM3-GC3.05 global climate model (GCM) developed at the Met Office Hadley Centre (MOHC)  and 13 other climate models from around the world. The UKCP18 Land Projections Report (Murphy et al.  2018) flagged that there was a potentially spurious change in global temperature in the first 40 years of the  historical simulation for member 01. This report investigates this further for all 15 MOHC model variants,  and provides some user guidance on the issue of model drifts (next page) followed by some technical detail  (sections 1-4). Key points are: •  Spurious long-term changes, or “drifts”, can occur in any GCM simulation, for reasons associated with the  experimental set up. Control GCM simulations, in which anthropogenic and natural external forcings are  held fixed at pre- or early- industrial values (we use 1900), are used to expose these drifts. A drift seen in  a control simulation will also affect GCM simulations where the anthropogenic forcing is varied, such as  the UKCP Global projections. •  In the 15 MOHC simulations, the largest drift occurs in temperature for the first 30 years of the  simulations, providing a spurious increase of 0.2 °C in that period. This drift comes mainly from the  Tropics and the Arctic. Most users only use data from a more recent period onwards, usually from 1961  or 1981, and this drift does not affect projected changes calculated this way. The user guidance provides  advice if data prior to 1940 is being used. •  After 1940, 13 of the 15 control GCM simulations are essentially steady in global mean temperature  with any drift being an order of magnitude smaller than the projected changes. We advise that there is  no need to adjust UKCP projections for these small drifts. This also applies to temperature and  precipitation in the UK from UKCP Global (60 km), UKCP Regional (12 km) and UKCP Local (2.2 km)  projections, as well as most worldwide regions in UKCP Global. An exception is that a few amongst the  13 members show temperature drifts around Antarctica. •  The two exceptions are members 11 and 12 (for which there are 60 km, 12 km, and 2.2 km versions),  which show steady weakening of the overturning circulation in the Atlantic Ocean. The user guidance  states that if both members 11 and 12 stand out from the other 13 members for a climate variable of  interest, then it is very likely related to the drift in the Atlantic Ocean and the two members should be  excluded from the user’s analysis. If, however, only one of these two members stands out then the  Atlantic drift could still be playing a role, but a user would be justified in including both these members.  However, both members are examples of an early collapse of the Atlantic overturning circulation, so  could be used to develop a storyline to cover this type of event.  •  The control simulations show that internal variability in the North Atlantic Oscillation and UK  temperature and precipitation varies across the 15 MOHC variants.  Source: Met Office © Crown Copyright 2020 www.metoffice.gov.uk Pg 3 of 20', 'chunk: The probabilistic, global and regional projections that comprise the UKCP18 land projections are derived  from climate models which approximate the real climate system. Hence there are systematic differences  between climate model results and observations (i.e. biases). In addition, climate models neglect unknown  effects of missing earth system processes. While the combined evidence of UKCP18 covers a broad range  of potential future climate pathways, it remains possible that observed future changes could lie outside the  envelope of these. Future generations of climate models will be developed that reflect improved scientific  capabilities and understanding, potentially leading to a requirement to update the UKCP18 projections  resulting in new, and potentially different, advice. The probabilistic projections  We have designed the probabilistic projections to provide the primary tool for assessments of the ranges of  uncertainties in UKCP18. For a given emissions scenario, they provide information on known uncertainties in  future climate changes. In particular, the aim is to represent uncertainties consistent with the knowledge  incorporated in existing ensembles of climate model projections, plus the effects of internal climate  variability. They are derived from a statistical framework that supports the formal application of  observational constraints and estimation of the relative likelihood of specific outcomes. However, we  emphasise that they are conditional on the knowledge, data, methods and subjective choices used to  construct them. As such, they should not be confused with (for example) probabilistic weather forecasts,  which can be assessed in a frequentist sense through repeated trial and verification (e.g. Hamill, 1997).  Other researchers could arrive at different results if  they made different choices. For a more detailed  discussion see Section 2.1 of the Land Projections Science Report, (Murphy et al, 2018). The probabilistic projections typically show broader ranges of outcomes than the global and regional  projections. This enables assessments across a larger set of climate futures than relying on a small set of  future outcomes, e.g. only using the climate models from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project  (CMIP5) that fed into the 5 th  Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  The probabilistic format should not be misinterpreted as an indication of high confidence in the weight of  evidence behind specific outcomes. That is, future developments in our physical understanding of climate  change drivers and improvements in climate modelling capability could lead in the future to revised  projections giving different probabilities for changes in UK variables. The probabilistic projections should be  seen as a source of broad guidance that forms a useful starting point for risk assessments.  The global, regional, local and derived projections The global, regional and local projections provide flexible datasets derived directly from climate model  output. These have full spatial and temporal coherence and offer information on a wider set of variables  (that are physically consistent), metrics and time scales than is available from the probabilistic projections.  These projections provide storylines of climate futures that you can use to develop case studies, stress-test  your system and decision options. You can also use the global and regional projections to build confidence in  your use of the data, by providing opportunities to explain the future outcomes that they represent. For  example, the global model provides information on large-scale drivers that affect the patterns of weather  that we experience in the UK. Drivers include the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, a large system  of ocean currents that carries warm water from the tropics northwards into the North Atlantic.

"""What are the advantages of using Local (2.2km) projections for climate change information?""","['chunk: The new Local (2.2km) provides the most physically realistic projections of extremes in local areas for  the coming decades and gives access to sub-daily information.  But, like the Regional (12km), Local (2.2km)  projections span a narrower range of uncertainty compared to the Global (60km) projections. Therefore, we  advise using the Local (2.2km) projections in parallel with other products in the UKCP18 toolkit. 1.8 The new UKCP Local (2.2km) provides, for the first time, national climate change information on a  similar resolution to that of current operational weather forecast models.  Local (2.2km) allows us to  simulate better the type of small-scale behaviour seen in the real atmosphere, including atmospheric  convection 2 , as well as the influence of mountains, coastlines and urban areas. Locally relevant information  can help to inform decision-making on future climate change, to enhance resilience, and adds further  capability to the UKCP18 suite of climate projection tools. 1.9 The new Local (2.2km) projections provide output at hourly scales which is needed for some user  applications, better informing future risk assessments.  Local (2.2km) provides data at kilometre and  hourly scales that can be directly fed into impact models and local decision-making tools. For example,  hourly rainfall data can be used to inform future changes in surface water flood risk for urban flood  management schemes and contingency planners. Data on future extreme heat can be used for decision- making around key infrastructure including bridges, trainlines and thermal performance of buildings. 1.10 Climate science is continually advancing.  We can expect new results to emerge during the coming years  from observations, and from new generations of global, regional and local climate models.

What are the notable influences of Atlantic Multidecadal Variability on European climate?,"['chunk: c.   Large-scale modes of variability   We evaluate El Niño-Southern Oscillation events (Figure 8), Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV,  Figure 9) and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO, Figure 10) comparing UKCP-Global with results  from 58 CMIP6 models in Figs. 8 and 9, and 64 in Fig. 10. Our assessment is limited to a simple “top- down” comparison of the intensity of variability in the relevant index values, preceded by a brief survey  of current understanding of their properties and influences.  ENSO influences climate anomalies in many world regions (Trenberth and Caron, 2000), especially  in the tropics through its effects on the Walker circulation.  Teleconnections from ENSO to seasonal  European climate are weaker, but specific influences are revealed by detailed analysis of observations.  For example, Fereday et al. (2008) found negative seasonal correlations between El Niño and a  circulation pattern resembling the positive phase of winter NAO, except for November–December which  shows the opposite relationship. In addition, Toniazzo and Scaife (2006) found that only weak or  moderate El Niños show the canonical negative NAO response in winter, while the strongest events  drive high pressure to the west of Europe that results from a tropospheric wave train originating from  the tropical Atlantic.  The NAO and AMV indices are important drivers of variability in European climate (e.g. Hurrell et  al., 2003; Sutton and Dong, 2012; O’Reilly et al., 2017; Rousi et al., 2020). The positive (negative) phases  of NAO drive higher (lower) winter precipitation and temperatures in northern Europe. For AMV,  notable influences on the UK include (in the positive phase) dry precipitation anomalies in spring and  wet anomalies in summer. AMV also exerts broader influences on decadal and longer time scales that  include rainfall in northeast Brazil and the Sahel, Atlantic hurricanes and North American (as well as  European) summer climate (Knight et al., 2006).  AMV is associated with low-frequency variability in the ocean circulation in the North Atlantic  (Delworth and Mann, 2000), but understanding the relative influences of internally-generated and  externally-forced variability remains an active topic of research. Booth et al. (2012), Bellucci et al. (2017)  and Bellomo et al. (2018) identify an external influence from anthropogenic aerosol forcing in climate  model simulations of the 20 th  century, while evidence of volcanic influence is also reported in studies of  observations and models (e.g. Swingeduow et al., 2017; Mann et al., 2021).  Internal NAO-driven variability contributes significantly to uncertainty in projected European  anomalies during the next few decades, but in historical data the dominance of internal variability  makes it difficult to identify any potential forced signal (Deser et al., 2017). Blackport and Fyfe (2022) do  find positive trends in observed NAO and North Atlantic jet stream data from 1951-2020. These lie  outside (for the jet data) and at the top end of (for NAO data) ranges found in a large ensemble of  coupled model simulations.

What role does the UK Storm Tide Forecasting Service play in coastal flood warnings?,"['chunk: Section summary: Our simulations are downscaled from general circulation models which evaluate well  against observed storm tracks (see section A2�2)� Simulated skew surges show a similar relationship  between changes of intensity and changes of frequency of extreme events to the relationship seen in  the tide-gauge records; in other words, the variability of the extremes is well-simulated� The components of our storm surge modelling system have been extensively evaluated: a very similar surge  model (CS3X) is used operationally to provide coastal flood warnings in the UK as part of the Storm Tide  Forecasting Service (STFS), and model performance is routinely monitored at the National Oceanography  Centre Liverpool by comparing forecast results with observations every month. Typical root-mean-square  errors are about 10cm (e.g. Furner et al, 2016 and  http://www.ntslf.org/storm-surges/storm-surge-model ).  The operational model has been shown to perform particularly well during extreme storm surges in the  southern North Sea (Horsburgh et al, 2008), forecasting surge in the Thames estuary to within 10cm when  driven by re-analysed meteorology. Further evaluation of the modelling system was reported in UKCP09  (Lowe et al, 2009) and TE2100 (Howard et al, 2008).  To make a comprehensive comparison of simulated extremes with observations for the historical period, we  compare return level curves of skew surge from nine tide gauges with the corresponding data from the  nearest grid-point in the surge model, in Figure A2.3.1.

In this context, a historical simulation means only that the  radiatively-active gas concentration is based on observations, whereas the reanalysis is an attempt to  reconstruct the weather of a period consistent with assimilation into a numerical weather prediction model.

Analysis of UKCP Global, Regional, and Local projections for changes relative to a recent baseline period  •  For users of UKCP Global, Regional, or Local projections looking at data post-1940, there is no impact on  any analysis that you have already carried out unless you have found members 11 and/or 12 (referred to  as r001i1p02305 and r001i1p02335 on UKCP User Interface) behaving very differently to the rest of  the ensemble. •  Members 11 and 12 experience a spurious, steady weakening of the strength in Atlantic overturning  circulation. You need to check if they stand out from the other 13 MOHC variants (which also have ids  starting with “r001i1p0”) for the climate variable of interest. If both do, then it is likely that the Atlantic  drift is causing this, and you should exclude those two members from your analysis. If, however, only one  of these two members stands out then the Atlantic drift could still be playing a role, you would be  justified in including both these members. However, members 11 and 12 are examples of an early  collapse of the Atlantic overturning circulation, so you might be interested in using these two members  as examples of this type of future storyline.  •  Members 11 and 12 are two of the members used in the UKCP Regional (12 km) and UKCP Local (2.2  km) projections, that is, two of the projections that were downscaled to 12 km using the Regional  Climate Model (RCM), and 2.2 km using the Convection Permitting Model (CPM). The same advice  applies to the two RCM and CPM simulations driven by members 11 and 12. •  This advice applies anywhere in the world except near Antarctica (in particular, the Weddell Sea) where  there are drifts. You should not analyse regions near Antarctica in the UKCP Global projections. Analysis of Global Projections prior to 1940 •  Prior to 1940 there is a drift in temperature, notably a rise of 0.2 °C in global temperature which occurs  mainly in the Tropics and Arctic. You should consider whether the early drift might affect your analysis  based on the technical part of this report. We advise testing whether omitting data prior to 1940 makes  a significant difference to your results and your decision. If it does, do not use the data prior to 1940;  otherwise it is fine to use the full data set. •  The previous point applies worldwide in UKCP Global. It does not affect the UKCP Regional or Local  Projections, as they start after 1940.  As our advice does not require data from the control simulations, we do not plan to release the data that is  analysed in this report. Research users wishing to further investigate the drift results or to analyse internal  variability in the simulations should contact the UKCP helpdesk in the first instance to discuss options.

What are the key findings from the comparison between the original and new UKCP18 projections as discussed in the provided text?,"['chunk: In this section we compare the new projections (including all five updates) against the original UKCP18  projections, using a selection of statistics and examples from the UKCP18 regions and variables. Section 3.1  compares the results in tabular form, considering the 25km OSGB projections and the aggregated national  projections. Section 3.2 presents a selection of time-dependent pdfs (“plumes”), comparing the P10 (low),  P50 (median) and P90 (high) quantiles for the original and new projections for different regions, scenarios,  variables and meaning periods. Finally, Section 3.3 compares maps of response for the 25km gridded data.  We focus on projections for winter and summer, considering mainly changes for 2070-2089 relative to  1981-2000 under RCP85.

Tables comparing Original and New Projections This section includes a set of tables providing quantitative comparisons between the new and original  projections. Sub-section a considers the local pdfs on the OSGB (25km) national grid, and sub-section b  provides corresponding statistics for the set of 43 aggregated regions. In both cases, the statistics are  compiled as average results across all UK locations. In sub-section c we provide tables for the national  aggregated-region definitions.  a.  Probabilistic projections at the 25-km scale We start by discussing UK averages of projected P10, P50 and P90 changes at 25km-scale boxes for 2070- 2089 relative to 1981-2000 under RCP85. Average values from the original and new projections are  provided for all probabilistic projection variables in Table 3. We also provide the F med  and F spread  diagnostics of  equations (3) and (4). These measure respectively the difference in the P50 response and the P90 – P10  spread of responses, expressed in both cases relative to the spread in the new projections. In this case,  results from the original UKCP18 projections replace results from the interim projections in the equations.  The results from Table 3 show the combined influences of all five developments. These can be compared  with results from Table 1, which isolates the contribution of correcting the downscaling error (this being the  only difference between the interim and new projections).

What does the comparison of model performance and underlying processes reveal about the reliability of future projections in CPM-12 and RCM-PPE?,"['chunk: In this section we draw on the assessment of present-day model performance (Section 3) and our  understanding of the representation of underlying processes (from differences in model physics, Section 2),  to assess the relative confidence we have in the future projections of CPM-12 compared to those of RCM- PPE. Where CPM-12 and RCM-PPE projections (Section 4) agree, due to these being driven by large-scale  processes common to both models, we suggest that the CPM and RCM results provide equally plausible  projections of future change. Where CPM-12 and RCM-PPE projections disagree, we examine the  underlying processes that are likely to be responsible, and hence the extent to which the CPM may or may  not provide a more reliable estimate of future change. This assessment then has implications for deciding  which of the UKCP18 data products (CPM-12, RCM-PPE and also Strand 1 and Strand 2) may be most  appropriate to use for a given application. For several key temperature and precipitation metrics, Table 5.1 summarises the extent to which present- day biases are reduced in CPM-12 compared to RCM-PPE, whether the future changes are different  between the models, and our understanding of these differences in terms of the key processes that are  represented differently in the CPM. In this we are primarily considering differences in the central estimates  of future change. However, although the central estimates may be similar, CPM-12 and RCM-PPE may  provide somewhat different estimates of the uncertainty in future changes. In particular RCM-PPE samples  parameter uncertainty in the regional model and uncertainty in the large-scale driving conditions, whilst  CPM-12 samples local conditions given uncertainty in the large-scale driving conditions only (with no  parameter perturbations applied to the CPM itself). Importantly, neither of these ensembles samples  structural model uncertainty (due to different parameterisation scheme s or model architectures), and a  wider sampling of uncertainty (including multi-model ensemble information) is provided in Strands 1 and 2  of UKCP18 (Murphy et al, 2018). Later in this section we compare the sampling of uncertainty across the  different UKCP18 products, for some key variables, and discuss this in the context of user requirements.

"""What objectives does the British forestry sector deliver and how has climate change affected their planning and management?""","['chunk: The British forestry sector delivers a range of objectives ranging  from habitats, timber production to recreation. Many of the mature  forests in the landscape today were planted in the mid-20th century  prior to concerns that climate change might affect their long term  ability to deliver ecosystem services.  Today, the forest planning and management community across the  private and public sector are aware that tree species choice should  account for site conditions in current and future climates. Their  informed decisions should sustain tree species in the landscape  and also the ecosystem services they provide, such as timber   and recreation.  Traditionally, foresters use land or forest management plans to  decide which species they want to grow and when they will harvest  them – driven by the different growth rates for coniferous and  broadleaves species. As forest plantations are continuously felled  and replanted forest planners need to update plans and use tools  that can help them quickly assess which tree species can be the  most tolerant to prevailing average and extreme climate conditions  such as warmer temperatures or increased precipitation. The  typical planning horizon is around 50 years for conifers managed via  clearfell systems but can be as much as 150 years for broadleaved  species such as oak. Ecological Site Classification (ESC)  To support foresters’ decisions,  Forest Research developed ESC in the 1990s. ESC is delivered as a  computer-based tool for appraising tree species’ potential by soil,  accumulated temperature and other climatic variables. This tool is now  widely used in forest planning at multiple spatial scales, ranging from  individual sites (less than 10 hectares), forest block (10-1000 hectares)  through to national scales.']","The British forestry sector delivers objectives ranging from habitats, timber production to recreation.

What are the differences in precipitation patterns between the RCM and CPM models as described in the Met Office report?,"['chunk: •  1) Influence of baseline.  In the present-day, winter mean precipitation is higher in the RCM than CPM  over land and the coastal sea areas (although winter mean precipitation is lower over the North Atlantic  to the northwest of the UK). This is linked to precipitation being more frequent in the parameterised  convection model, with many fewer dry days/hours (Section 3.4). Given that total precipitation is higher  in the RCM than in the CPM, processes leading to the local formation of precipitation must act more in  the RCM (since the same moisture is being advected in through the lateral boundaries), with higher  evaporation rates over sea in the RCM (Table 4.1). This is also true in the future climate, although with  smaller relative differences between the models. In future, the greater increase in winter mean  precipitation in the CPM over land is due to a greater increase in precipitation occurrence (Section 4.3),  as well as a greater increase in the contribution from intense  precipitation events (see point 2 below).  Given the large number of wet days/hours in the baseline climate in the RCM, there is less scope for this  to increase in the future (c.f. Figs 5.2 and 5.3 for relationship between present-day biases and future  changes for seasonal mean precipitation). Indeed, we find that the number of wet days/hours over land  actually decreases in the RCM in future over the eastern side of the UK (Section 4.3), in part offsetting  the increased precipitation over the western side associated with orography (see point 2). •  2) Role of orography   The largest precipitation events (in terms of hourly or daily accumulations) mostly  occur over orography in winter. It is these large events which are the main contributors to the total  precipitation (rather than the much more numerous light events) and which show the largest future  changes in actual contribution to total precipitation (Section 4.4). In the RCM it rains much more  frequently over orography, with a tendency for too much continuous generation of rain over the  mountains (Section 3.3, Fig 3.3.4). The CPM does not rain as frequently (although when it does, it does so  with greater intensity), leading to lower mean precipitation on the upslopes in the present-day (Section  3.2). Given the more frequent nature of orographic precipitation in the RCM in the present-day, there is  less scope for this to increase in future. In addition, the increases in precipitation contribution from the  highest intensities over orography in future are greater in t he CPM than RCM (Section 4.4).

Also shown  are (centre) differences between the CPM_fix and CPM_UKCP responses, (centre right) the standard  deviation of responses across the original 12-member UKCP CPM ensemble and (right) the difference  on fixing the error minus the ensemble standard deviation. 19 years of data for each of the future  (Dec 2060 to Nov 2079) and present-day (Dec 1980 to Nov 1999) periods are used.  Impact on lighting  Lightning data was not released to users in the original UKCP Local (2.2km) projections launched in  September 2019. This was due to issues around the verification of lightning in the CPM compared to  Arrival Time Difference Network (ATDnet) observations. Therefore, only a subjective evaluation of  lightning output from the CPM was possible, as discussed in the UKCP CPM science report (Kendon  et al., 2019). Initial results suggested that the UKCP CPM overestimates lightning in winter but  performs better in summer in terms of representing the UK-average occurrence rate, but with  potential deficiencies in the spatial distribution of lightning. It is likely that these deficiencies were at  least in part due to the graupel code error in the original UKCP CPM.  Overall, we find that lightning occurrence is reduced in the run with the graupel code error fixed  (CPM_fix), consistent with a reduction in excessive graupel. Here we present results from a case  study looking at graupel, lightning and precipitation on the 6 th  July 1983 (Fig 25). The graupel  amounts are considerably reduced in CPM_fix, and some unrealistic features present in CPM_UKCP,  such as an unusual linear feature near the western boundary of the simulation domain and  rectangular-shaped features in Ireland (which are clear indications of the graupel code error), are  not apparent in CPM_fix. Consistent with these graupel differences, lightning occurrence is also  reduced in CPM_fix, along with the removal of similar unrealistic features. It is notable that despite  significant differences in graupel amounts and lightning, away from the simulation domain  boundary, precipitation rates are very similar between the original and fixed-code runs.\nheading: Fig 24.
